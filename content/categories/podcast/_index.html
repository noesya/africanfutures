  Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur sheds light on individual and collective actions across Europe, Africa and the Americas to defend racial equality and justice. Our guests - scholars, activists, artists - share their practice with us, highlighting both the forms that historical and contemporary racial violence takes in these different contexts, and examples of possible reforms and mobilizations. Through their experiences fighting against racism, we draw the contours of racial justice efforts today.
