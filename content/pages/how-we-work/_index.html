Through our mandate and the way we work, we combat <strong>racial inequalities</strong>, which are intertwined with, but do not erase, other inequalities of gender, class, name, religion, sexual orientation, and ability. <br>Recognizing that the production of knowledge is profoundly political, we <strong>center historically marginalized voices</strong>, whether they be marginalized on the basis of race, nationality, gender, religion, ability, or other factors. <br>We are <strong>knowledge brokers</strong>. Our aim is not to replace activists but rather to support their efforts and bolster their work (as well as that of policymakers) by facilitating exchanges with other stakeholders with the same mission. <br>We are <strong>action-oriented</strong>: Ideas and knowledge developed in the lab should inform public discussions and orient decision-makers in their efforts to undertake reforms. <br>Our scope is <strong>transnational</strong>: We believe that movements for justice for historical harms benefit from collaborations across borders. <br>We adopt a <strong>cross-disciplinary</strong> approach: We value the wide range of forms that expertise takes, and we invite as many different forms of expertise around the proverbial table as possible. We believe that expanding the table strengthens the work.
