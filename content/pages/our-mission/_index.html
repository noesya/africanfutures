        <p><b>African Futures strengthens the efforts of activists, researchers, and policymakers pursuing racial justice and the recognition of the enduring effects of colonialism and slavery.</b><br></p><p>From Black Lives Matter in the United States to protests in Europe calling for the legacies of colonialism and slavery to be addressed, societies across the world are faced with a pressing need to acknowledge their historical injustices and address the structural racism rooted in their social fabric.<br></p><p>Since the 2020 uprisings in response to the murder of George Floyd, partial and ad hoc responses have been undertaken by a number of states, including the restitution of artifacts, the payment of unilateral reparations, and the beginnings of transitional justice procedures between European and African nations. But these efforts remain both piecemeal and largely limited to institution-to-institution agreements.</p><p>African Futures provides a <b>space for knowledge development and for the exchange of strategies </b>between activists, researchers, and policymakers pursuing racial justice efforts and the recognition of the enduring effects of colonialism and slavery.<br></p>
