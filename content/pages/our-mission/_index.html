<p><b>African Futures strengthens the efforts of activists, researchers and policymakers pursuing racial justice and the recognition of the enduring effects of colonialism and slavery.<br></b><br></p><p>From Black Lives Matter in the United States to protests in Europe calling for the legacies of colonialism and slavery to be addressed, societies across the world are faced with a pressing need to acknowledge their historical injustices and address the structural racism rooted in their social fabric.<br><br></p><p>Since the 2020 uprisings in response to the murder of George Floyd in the United States, partial and ad hoc responses have been undertaken by some states, including the restitution of artefacts, the payment of unilateral reparations, and the beginnings of transitional justice procedures between European and African nations. But these efforts remain both piecemeal and largely limited to institution-to-institution agreements.</p><p><br>African Futures provides a <b>space for knowledge development and for the exchange of strategies </b>between activists, researchers and policymakers pursuing racial justice efforts and the recognition of the enduring effects of colonialism and slavery.<br><br>The African Futures Action Lab is housed in <a href="http://anthropology.mit.edu/"><b>MIT’s Anthropology department</b></a>, with current partners and activities located in Accra, Algiers, Brussels, Boston and Lomé. We operate in English and French.</p>
