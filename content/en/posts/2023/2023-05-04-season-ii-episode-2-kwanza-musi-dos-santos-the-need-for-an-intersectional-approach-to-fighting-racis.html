        <p>In this episode, <b>Kwanza Musi dos Santos</b>, Italian activist and co-founder of anti-racist organization <b>Questaèroma</b>, speaks with us about the state of the struggle against racism and xenophobia in Italy. </p><p>Among other topics, Kwanza discusses the challenges of Italy’s citizenship law, how the country’s colonial past and migration are addressed in national politics, and the implications of the recent election of a far-right government for the fight against racism (it’s not as straightforward as you might think!).</p><p>Pointing to the links between casual and structural racism, the enduring silences around Italy’s colonial past, and anti-immigrant violence, Kwanza highlights the need for intersectional activism that addresses racism, homophobia, and xenophobia jointly. And, importantly, she shares her tips on how to stay hopeful in a persistently difficult political landscape.</p><p>*</p><p>Kwanza Musi dos Santos is an Italian and Afro-Brazilian activist based in Rome. She is a co-founder of <a href="https://questaeroma.it/">Questaèroma</a>, a sports and culture association fighting discrimination in Rome through arts and culture activities, mainly for youth and people of color. </p><p>Kwanza is an expert in Diversity & Inclusion. At the moment, she’s working with organizations in both the private and public sectors. Kwanza  also recently authored the chapter <a href="https://www.transcript-publishing.com/978-3-8376-5413-4/mapping-black-europe/">“Black Rome”</a> in the book<i> <a href="https://www.transcript-publishing.com/978-3-8376-5413-4/mapping-black-europe/">Mapping Black Europe: Monuments, Markers, Memories</a></i> (Natasha Kelly & Olive Vassell, Eds., 2023)</p>
