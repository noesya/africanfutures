        <p><br><br><br><br></p><p><b>Duration</b>: 2 months, June-July 2023 (flexible); includes field research.<br></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>Application deadline: Ongoing, until the position is filled.<br></b></i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Required qualifications:<br></b></p><p><br></p><ul> <br><li>PhD or equivalent degree in qualitative and/or quantitative social sciences.<br>Relevant disciplines include, but are not limited to, sociology, anthropology,<br>history, political science and legal studies.</li> <br><li>Thematic expertise in reparations, restorative justice and/or racial justice<br>movements in Cameroon.</li> <br><li>Demonstrated experience in qualitative and/or quantitative social science<br>research, including field research.</li> <br><li>Proven experience in conducting operational research.</li> <br><li>Excellent writing skills, demonstrated by a record of publications.</li> <br><li>Required languages skills: French, English, one or more national languages<br>of the country.</li> <br> </ul><p><br></p><p><b>1) Project context<br></b></p><p><br></p><p>The African Futures Lab's (AfaLab) mission is to bring recognition and redress to past<br>and contemporary structural racial inequalities in Africa and Europe through the<br>development and exchange of rigorous, empirically-based knowledge. The<br>knowledge generated by this work informs the efforts of activists and policymakers.<br></p><p>To this end, AfaLab documents racial inequalities and racial justice movements<br>through large-scale quantitative data collection and in-depth case studies. Building<br>on this empirical foundation, AfaLab promotes knowledge exchange among social<br>actors engaged in the fight against racial inequality and supports advocacy efforts by<br>producing empirically-based policy recommendations for states, international<br>organizations, and grassroots actors.<br></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><b>2) Project description: "Advancing the Reparations Agenda for Colonial<br>Crimes and Slavery in Africa"<br></b></p><p><br></p><p>The issue of reparations for the historical injustices of colonization and slavery is<br>once more on the international agenda. </p><p>In recent years - and as result of pressure<br>from civil society actors - European states such as Belgium, the Netherlands and<br>Germany have undertaken processes of recognition of colonial violence in their<br>former African colonies, while international organizations such as the United Nations<br>have multiplied calls for states to make reparations for colonial and slavery-related<br>violence. </p><p>At the African Union level, a continental agenda for reparations is beginning<br>to take shape. But this growing attention to the issue of reparations cannot happen<br>without the contributions of African civil society.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Civil society on the African continent has already demonstrated its willingness to<br>have colonial crimes and their political, economic, social, and material consequences<br>recognized. For example, in East Africa, former Mau Mau fighters filed a lawsuit<br>seeking reparations for the torture they suffered during the struggle for<br>independence.</p><p>In North Africa, the Tunisian Truth and Dignity Commission<br>established in 2014 demanded in its final report reparations from France for the<br>massive human rights violations committed by the French army between March 1956<br>and July 1961, which resulted in over 7,000 Tunisian victims. </p><p>However, the<br>Commission's demands went unheeded. More recently, in southern Africa, after<br>years of negotiations, the Namibian government, obtained an apology from Germany<br>for the genocide that the colonial government perpetrated against the Nama and<br>Herero people in the early 20th century.</p><p><br></p><p>Despite these advances, the scale and scope of ongoing efforts pale in comparison<br>to the scope of the crimes committed and their profound and lasting impact on<br>African societies, lives, and economies.<br></p><p><br></p><p>In order to contribute to the development of an African agenda based on sound, data-<br>driven knowledge, African Futures Lab launched the project "Advancing the<br>Reparations Agenda for Colonial Crimes and Slavery in Africa," supported by the<br>Open Society-Africa, has the following objectives:</p><p><br></p><ul> <br><li> <br><b>Strengthen African civil society organizations' demands for reparations</b> related to colonial violence and slavery through sound, data-driven knowledge<br> </li> <br><li> <br><b>Coordinate the efforts of African civil society actors</b> in developing a<br>reparations agenda for colonial violence and slavery</li> <br><li> <br><b>Inform the development of policies</b> related to reparations for colonial crimes<br>and slavery at the international, regional, and national levels (in former<br>colonial powers and former colonized states) with recommendations from<br>African civil society actors</li> <br> </ul><p><br><br></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><br><br><br><br></p><p><b>3) Specific project objectives</b></p><p><br><br><br><br><br></p><p>As part of this broader initiative, we are carrying out research projects focusing on<br>each of the five regions of Africa. Each region is studied by one or two researchers.<br>This call specifically concerns one researcher for 1 country in the Central African<br>region: <b>Cameroon</b>.<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Objectives</b>: To take stock of ongoing mobilizations for reparations in each region<br>and/or to analyze specific cases of reparations demands.<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Specific questions that may guide the analysis:<br></b></p><p><br></p><ul> <br><li>What are the demands for reparations for crimes committed during<br>colonization?</li> <br><li>Who are the actors making these demands? With what resources (political,<br>legal, media, material)? Which allies?</li> <br><li>In which arenas are demands being brought? To whom are they addressed?</li> <br><li>What is the history of these demands?</li> <br><li>What do these demands for reparations make possible for the mobilized<br>actors? What do they make difficult?<br> </li> <br> </ul><p><br></p><p><b>Operational aims of the research</b>: To enable society actors to develop a political/<br>legal/communication strategy for their demands for reparations for the historical<br>crimes and contemporary legacies of colonialism and slavery.<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Duration</b>: 2 months (June- July 2023). Those dates are flexible.<br><b><br>Collaboration </b>with civil society actors and local universities is at the heart of this research.</p><p><br></p><p>Two elements are central to this research:<b> It is operational in focus</b> and <b>it must<br>start from existing civil society actors' mobilizations on the ground</b>. The<br>methodology can be qualitative or quantitative.<br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Female applicants are strongly encouraged.<br></i></p><p><br></p><p><b>Please send your CV and cover letter to </b>info@afalab. org. </p><p><br><br><br><br></p>
