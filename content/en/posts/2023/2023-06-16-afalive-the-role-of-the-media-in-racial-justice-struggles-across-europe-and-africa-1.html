        <p>On one hand, The Guardian’s acknowledgement this past March of its founders’ links to the transatlantic slave trade as part of its Cotton Capital special series and the NYTimes’ publication last year of “The Ransom,” a special series on the reparations that Haiti was forced to pay to France for its independence. On the other hand, a 500% increase in the use of a racial slur on Twitter following the platform’s take-over earlier this year. <br></p>

        <p>Traditional news media and online media alike have a clear influence on not only drawing and raising attention to the debates and discourses around racial justice, whether in the Global North or South, but also on shaping them. They can also  serve as a platform for protest and for the denunciation of racial injustices and they can also vehicle racist discourses, stereotypical narratives, and even enable rising extreme right-wing groups to spread their racial hatred and ideology. Indeed, media today - as ever - are doing more than merely relaying information; they are actors in the fight for reparations and racial justice more broadly. <br></p>
