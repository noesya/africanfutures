        <p>Like many of you, we feel powerless and overwhelmed by the outpouring of murderous violence in Israel and Palestine in recent weeks. The death toll in Gaza has risen to more than <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/11/1143107" target="_blank">8,805 people, including more than 3,648 children</a>, and hundreds more are being killed every day by Israel's relentless bombardment. We join a global chorus calling for an immediate ceasefire, as repeatedly requested by the United Nations, and for the return of the hostages.</p>

        <p>While we have no doubt about the need to condemn Hamas's terrorist attacks on Israeli, which led to the death of 1,400 civilians and the kidnapping of over 200, it is important to condemn the indiscriminate violence unleashed by the State of Israel against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian people cannot be collectively punished for the crimes of Hamas and the State of Israel has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.</p><p>As an organization fighting against the historical injustices of colonization and its contemporary consequences, it is crucial for us to point out that this violence by the State of Israel against Palestinian civilians is not taking place in a vacuum, to <a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1698160848-un-chief-says-hamas-massacre-didn-t-happen-in-a-vacuum" target="_blank">use the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations</a>, but rather <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/fr/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/" target="_blank">in a context of apartheid, which has been condemned by the international community</a> for many years now. Addressing this underlying and fundamental injustice is the only way to achieve lasting peace and some measure of justice in the region.</p><p>We are inspired by the mobilizations of civil society around the world in defense of a ceasefire in Gaza. We call on the leaders of the African Union and the European Union, and the international community as a whole, to heed these calls and to demand an immediate ceasefire and an end to war crimes. They must ensure the protection of civilians and access to humanitarian aid for Gaza.</p><p>Alongside the heart-wrenching loss of life in Palestine and Israel, we also want to draw attention to the thousands of lives that have been lost and continue to be lost every day as a result of armed conflict on the African continent, and that also have their roots in colonial and neocolonial violence.</p><p>We call on the leadership of the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations, and international institutions widely to take the necessary steps to ensure that civilian populations in Israel and Palestine regain peace, justice, and security.</p>
