        <p>This article aims to shed light on how Western legal and judicial institutions have been maintained despite their inadequacy in African countries, as well as how this continuity inflicts violence on African populations.</p><p>The modernization paradigm at the heart of the colonial process which explains the establishment of Western court systems in African society has not only been maintained, it has been buttressed by international development institutions whose policies are reproducing Western visions of law and judicial institutions, at least in part, to promote economic growth and ensure the security of foreign investors.</p><p>This article shows how the inadequacies of these policies have led to multiple forms of violence perpetrated against African populations deprived of their access to justice.  </p><p>Authors: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-moriceau-30566a18/" target="_blank">Julien Moriceau,</a> &amp; <a href="https://africanfutures.mit.edu/team/liliane-umubyeyi/" target="_blank">Liliane Umubyeyi, PhD </a></p>
