description: >
  Some states in the Global North, such as the United States or Belgium, have recently used transitional justice mechanisms to deal with their colonial or slavery past. Based on her experience on the African continent, Annah Moyo presents in this video the opportunities and constraints of transitional justice processes to address colonial and slavery crimes.
description_short: >
  This video is part of a MIT’s course given during Fall 2021 : « Reparations for Slavery and Colonization: Contemporary Movements for Justice ». It discusses what transitional justice is and how it applies to post-colonial countries in Africa seeking reparations.
