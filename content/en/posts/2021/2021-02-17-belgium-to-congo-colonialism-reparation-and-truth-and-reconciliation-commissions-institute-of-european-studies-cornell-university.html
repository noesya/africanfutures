        <p>Convened by the Institute of European Studies- Cornell University and featuring Liliane Umubyeyi and Amah Edoh on the panel of speakers, this webinar explores the theme of reparations and restitution to bring justice to the residual inequalities caused by slavery and colonization. It focuses on recent developments to institute a sort of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Belgium, which was approved in Summer 2020 in the form of a parliamentary Special Commission to scrutinize the country's colonial past.<br></p>
