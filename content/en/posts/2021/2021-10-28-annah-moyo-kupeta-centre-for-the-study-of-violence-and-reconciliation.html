        ANNAH MOYO: My name is Annah Yvonne Moyo.I am currently acting executive directorat the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation.CSVR in short based in Johannesburg, South Africa.I am a transitional justice expertand have worked extensively on the African continenton transitional justice issues from addressing colonial eralegacies through transitional justice,addressing economic issues through transitional justice,but also addressing some of the currentand emerging challenges and issues in practicethrough transitional justice.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you so much for taking the timetoday to discuss with us.Maybe before we start with the main topic,could you tell us what is transitional justice?I'm sure there are a lot of people who don'tknow what this term means.ANNAH MOYO: Transitional justice basicallyrefers to a set of measures that include truth, reparations,justice, and accountability and guarantees of non recurrenceor conflict that are aimed at addressingthe consequences of conflict, consequencesof authoritarian rule, and other incidents thatbring about gross human rights violationsand other human rights violationsand crimes in a particular setting, be it a society,a nation, a country, or a region.That is the simple definition of transitional justice.On the African continent, for instance,we have expanded this definition to really also includespecific tenets of transformationor transformative justice, so to speak.So we are looking at these measures,including formal and non-formal measures or mechanismsalso including traditional justice mechanismsto implemented the crown together with formal justicemechanisms to address consequences of violence,consequences of some of the tendenciesand incidents in Africa, including legaciesof Africa's brutal past to ensure that we move awayfrom that history of brutalization and violationsto economic transformation, developmental justice,and transformative justice.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: And have you used that frameworkin the context of CSVR to tackle the colonial crimesor the legacies of colonialism on the continent or somewhereelse in the world?ANNAH MOYO: Indeed, Liliane.We are using that framework to address a number of occurrenceson the continent.If you look at a number of countrieson the African continent, some of the conflictsthat we are experiencing currently reallystem from some of the unresolved issues of the past.The colonial era legacies issues.Of land in Africa.That has not yet been redistributed, for instance,from the colonial era honors, for instance,is one of the root causes of conflict in Africa.Issues of access to resources, access to opportunities,for instance, access, for instance,to development in Africa still very muchis an unresolved issue of the past.So we are using this framework of addressingthe unresolved issues of the past and the colonial eralegacies through transitional justiceto ensure that we deal with issuesof redistributive justice through transitional justice.We deal with the issues, for instance,of addressing some of the past issues, for instance,the high levels of inequality in a number of African countriesreally stem from Africa's unequal pastwhen it comes to the rights, the access,and opportunities that are available for citizensvis a vis those available.For instance, for colonial masters or colonial era owners,for instance.Those who colonized Africa in the past.So we have an Africa, where our colonial erahonors, or colonial era masters livealongside the majority of Africans who are poor,who are excluded from the mainstream economic activitybecause of the segregation and the exclusionary lawsduring colonial era.So how do we address some of those issues?We really need to rethink and relook at some of the issues,for instance, the inequalities brought about by colonialismin Africa, addressing them as someof the root causes of the current conflictsthat we experience in Africa.Some of the tensions we see in a number of countries,for instance, are really need us to adoptthat lens of addressing some of these issuesthrough transitional justice and addressing themfrom a redistributive justice lens.That is one of the elements enshrined in the African UnionTransitional Justice Policy as an element or a pillarof transitional justice to addresssome of these issues stemming from Africa's brutal past.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Can you give usconcrete examples of how you are youare mobilizing this framework with specific countries?ANNAH MOYO: Certainly.Some countries, for instance, like Namibia are currentlyundertaking an audit around the land reform agenda,for instance.So we are coming in saying, thereis a need to use transitional justicelens to that discussion.It cannot be simply a matter of land expropriation.It has to be an issue that is lookedfrom a transitional justice lens,through risk redistributive justice that I spoke about.How does it look like from a transitional justice lens?How do we address this as an issue of the past?The unresolved past the colonial era legacy in Namibia,for instance.That, for instance, is causing tensionsin the current governance in Namibia.So having a transitional justice lensthen will ensure that we look at land ownership issues,and look at, for instance, who werethe original owners of the land priorbefore colonial colonization and seeking thento at least redistribute land equally evenlyamongst the populace of Namibia.So a transitional justice look thenforces us, not only to look at itfrom an economic point of view or from a land ownershippoint of view, but to really look at who are the owners.In some instances, colonial landsbelonging to ethnic groups was taken.So some of it really will requirethat we redistribute that land to the original ownersand ensure that that ownership of the landto the original settlers is retained.But at the same time, addressing the high levels of inequalityin the country through transitional justice.So with transitional justice we arelooking at addressing or redressing some of the wrongs--the colonial era wrongs--at the same time, ensuring that we are transformingand developing the lives of Namibianscurrently in the current dispensation,ensuring that issues of equity equitable redistributionof resources of land and opportunitiesfor agriculture, for economic development,and economic empowerment are distributed evenlyacross races, across ethnic groups,ethnicity, and across the population,the whole population, and the people of Namibia.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you very much,and I guess it's very obvious when you are on a continent.And when you can see every day like the different waysin which colonialism is still presentand its legacy is still structuringthe lives of the population.But what about-- do you think that weare this framework of transitional justicecould be useful in tackling the legacies of colonialismin the global North, where maybe states like here and in Belgiumcould be inclined to say it's somethingwhich happened in the past which belongs to the past,it's not the present anymore.So first of all, do you think it's relevant,it could be useful, and how could it be done?ANNAH MOYO: Thank you, Liliane for that question.Issues of the past can never reallybe buried with the past, which iswhy, for instance, many former colonial countries willbe pushing for to say it's in the past,let's let bygones be bygones.Let's move forward, but really, the past--at least in the African continent-- continuesto haunt the present and it also threatens the future,for instance, because some of those legaciescontinue to be to manifest themselvesas root causes of current conflictsand current manifestations of tensions thatlead to conflict that can easily lead to gross human rightsviolations.So definitely, we need to revisit the past.If you look at a country like Germany, for instance, in 2018,Germany developed a transition adjusted strategyto deal with the past, especiallyin the African countries that wereformer colonies of Germany.Again, this was an acknowledgment by Germanyof the fact that we cannot really bury the past.The past is very much present.The only way we can move forward and really beginthe development--begin to give developmental aid to some of these countriesis really by first and foremost addressing the past,because even though we may say we are moving forwardcollectively, but the very communities,the ethnic groups that were affected by genocide,gross human rights violations are slaveryand many other international crimesthat happened during the colonial eraare very much wounded.They are still a wounded.The past is not in the past, but still very much alive.The experiences have been passed on through generationsthrough narration oral history you name it.So communities are aware of what happened, and therefore, whennothing is being seen to be done to address or redresscolonial era wrongs or legacies or crimes,then this fuels tensions amongst those communities,especially where the very same colonial era masters comein the name of providing aid, providingsupport and developmental and economic supportto the very countries that they previously committed atrocitiesand wrongs to.So that is the fuels that tension, especially whennow you look at other tensions, for instance,in other fault lines of ethnicity,fault lines of our political party, and associationamongst others.So inasmuch as if a particular president in the global Southmay accept that aid, but those who are aggrievedor those who are affected, if they belongto the opposite ethnic group, for instance,this tends to fuel tensions amongst community members.And we have seen some of these tensions becominga full blown conflict or full blown warsin some of the countries in Africa.Look at Angola, for instance.Look at countries, for instance, that are still now battlingwith a lot of with a lot of instability like Guineathat just had a coup recently.So these are some of the fault linesthat usually when we don't address the past,then the past continues to haunt the presentand it threatens the stability of the futureand the sustainable peace that we try to buildfor future generations.So there is a need to address the past in orderto secure the present and secure,again, a future that is free of violence and alsothat is transformational and leads to sustainable peace.So what I would say, for instance,for countries in the global North, especiallyEuropean countries,Europe, for instance, developed a transitional justice policy,but what is a big gap in this policyis addressing issues of the past?So we are having a policy in the European Unionthat focuses on current and future conflictswithout really addressing issues of the past.That, in itself, is a big gap, because we cannot dissociatethe past and the current occurrences of conflict in manyAfrican countries from the colonial era.So there is a need for a holistic approachto addressing conflicts in Africa that really go backto the past.The colonial era wrongs, the colonial era legaciesthat has been unresolved until now.And starting from there, in orderto build a culture of non-punity for thosewho committed those wrongs at the time,but also for future perpetrators of these crimes in the future,whether they are Africans or non Africans.And we are seeing a lot of proliferation,for instance, of guns coming from Europe, comingfrom the global North, for instance.So even the current conflicts, for instance,do have a starting point, they dohave instigators and fuelers.So the wrong of the global North can never reallybe overlooked in the current conflicts.And addressing some of these reallyhas to go back to the history, go back to the colonial erawrongs that were committed and startaddressing them coming from the past, coming to the present,and then seeking also to secure and builda transformative, sustainable, peaceful future.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Before-- thank you very much.It's fascinating.Before we start this recording, wewere talking about the technical nightmaresor technical nightmare that we facewhen we bring those crimes, the colonial crimes into courts.So what are the constraints of using the transitional justiceframework, because as you or you have said with many advantagesrelated to the fact that we can tackle the roots of conflicts.So I think in terms of proscription,we have more advantages.Maybe you can develop on that point,but what are the constraints?To what extent is it really the waythrough which people have to frame or to shapetheir struggles?ANNAH MOYO: Thank you, Liliane, for that question.Indeed, I have alluded to some of the advantagesand some of the opportunities for transitional justiceto address this.One of the biggest opportunities Ithink just before I go into the constraints.One of the opportunities of transitional justiceis that there is a recognition.For instance, when we are dealingwith these issues through transitional justicethat we are dealing with an abnormal situation, thattherefore calls for some form of flexibilityin terms of really looking at the narrower and veryrestrictive international law and international human rightstenets that seek to identify a perpetrator,seek to identify a victim, and therefore, the perpetratormust be brought to book and the victim must be redressed,but there must be reparation.But within a transitional justice, the higher numberof trade-offs built within the system,for instance, yes, perpetrators have to be identified.And there has to be acknowledgment of havingcommitted some wrongs.But at the same time, the kind of justicethat we are talking about is not perfect justice,it is justice that comes with a number of trade-offs, where,for instance, sometimes an apology can be takenis what is needed to redress, for instance,or to satisfy those who are victims reparations,not in the true sense of the full measure of whatthe victim suffered, but as a tokenor as a symbol of acknowledgment.So symbolic reparations are some of the trade-offs,for instance.So it's not your perfect justice,but it's justice that comes with trade-offs,but that also acknowledges the experiencesof those who suffered and also the perpetration of thosewho may have perpetrated the atrocitiesand those coming together coexistingtowards moving forward, being transformed, transformingperpetrators, and victims into active citizens whocan live alongside each other.Who can partner together in orderto build a sustainable, peaceful future.So some of the constraints of transitional justice, onceagain, is the fact that there may not be politicalwill, in most instances, from thosewho are seen to be perpetrators, especiallyfor colonial era wrongs.The states who may have perpetrated those atrocitiesmay not be willing to reopen the chapterto look at what happened, begin a process of truth seeking,then identification of perpetrators, acknowledgingthat indeed wrongs were committedand seeking to forge a path together with victimstowards addressing some of these atrocitiesand together achieving, or rather buildingtowards achieving sustainable peace in the long term.So there might not be any political will whatsoever.And transitional justice really relies on the political willand willingness of those who perpetratedthose atrocities and the victim, or rather the countriesto whom these wrongs were committed against.So that is the starting point.If this is not there, then any transitional justice talkswill definitely fail, because both partiesneed to come to the table, need to initiate that conversation,and map out a transitional justicestrategy on how this will be addressed.So that is number one constraint,and this is where, in most countries,even countries just where without in the global South,where there global North perpetrator,this is how many transitional justice processesfail because of that lack of political will.Another constraint that I can bring with transitional justiceonce again is just the issue around records.Because now, we are talking about whathappened in the past.Colonial era in many African countriesmeans more than 50 years of these atrocitieshaving been committed.Some are committed in the 1900s.We are in 2021, so the direct victims have passed away.So there was no record keeping at the time.So issues of record keeping to really determinewho was a victim, how they sufferedand all of those things.So archives are not available in many countries.So really it's a word of mouth or experiencesof victims passed on orally by word of mouththrough generations.So the first-hand narrative of what happened may not exist.Some countries have really done wellin terms of archiving what happenedor keeping a national collective of what happened in the past,but in many instances for transitional justice,especially when we are looking at reparations,a direct or rather individual reparations,this may not be enough, for instance,to secure individual reparations for direct victims.It may not be enough for instanceto secure a prosecution for those who may have committedthose atrocities.But of course, other international law principlesmay kick in that will really help transitional justiceprocesses.For instance, the International law principlein international human rights that even in instances wherethose who committed atrocities may notbe in government at the time but the most current governmentswould belong to that specific stateinherit the crimes committed by the previous governmentso they can still be held accountable.They can still be taken to court.They can still be called to answer or respondto some of the questions that may come uparound transitional justice reparations and so forthand they can make an apology.They can pay reparations to victims.They can make symbolic reparations.They can come to the party in termsof acknowledging and admitting the wrongs thatwere committed in the past.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you very much.It's very clear.You mentioned at some point that werebuilding a transitional justice strategy with the AfricanUnion.So do you think it's more--I mean on the issues of colonial crimes more relevantfrom the perspective of African countriesto work at the regional level rather thanat the national level?Yeah, and how this strategic, AU strategy, African Union,is going to be deployed, implement, and implemented?ANNAH MOYO: Thank you for that question.So the African Union developed the policy.It was adopted in 2019, and one of the issues that really itfocuses on is addressing the colonial eralegacies in Africa.And of course, the policy is continental,but it's still applying at a national level,for instance, for those countries that are affected.So the policy really is a guidelinefor member states undertaking transitional justice processes.So it provides a menu of transitional justice optionsthat a country that is undertaking a TJ processcan choose from in order to addressthe consequences of past violations,past and present violations.So the application is still very much at a national level,although the strategy really is applicable and existat the continental level.So really, it's still very much obliged at continental level.But there are definitely alternativesof applying it regionally, especially where someof conflicts take a regional turnor take a regional manifestation, for instance.So those opportunities exist, and in addressingsome of the regional concerns or regional manifestationsof conflict are some of the regional economic communitiesare also now engaging taking that continental transitionaljustice policy and developing their own regionalregion-specific transitional justice policiesor strategies to address some of the regional contextualrealities.So it can apply regionally.It can also apply nationally, but we are seeing a trend now,where there is a regional strategy that really seeksto address some of the regional realitiesand experiences of conflict.As we see with some of these issues like violent extremism,there is the regional connotation to them.So a regional approach is much morepreferred than a national approach that may not reallyaddress or redress the issues thataffect a specific region or a number of countrieswithin a region.LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you very much,and I'm looking forward to having a discussion with youand the students and activists, because I think you are youbring a number of very important elementsthat we have to consider when we address or thinkabout the possibility of pursuing justicefor colonial crimes in the context of Belgium.
