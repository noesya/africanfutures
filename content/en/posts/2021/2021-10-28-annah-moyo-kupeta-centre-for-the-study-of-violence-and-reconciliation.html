        Relevance of a transitional justice framework to address Belgium’s colonial past


      transcription: >-
        ANNAH MOYO: My name is Annah Yvonne Moyo.
        
        I am currently acting executive director
        
        at the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation.
        
        CSVR in short based in Johannesburg, South Africa.
        
        I am a transitional justice expert
        
        and have worked extensively on the African continent
        
        on transitional justice issues from addressing colonial era
        
        legacies through transitional justice,
        
        addressing economic issues through transitional justice,
        
        but also addressing some of the current
        
        and emerging challenges and issues in practice
        
        through transitional justice.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you so much for taking the time
        
        today to discuss with us.
        
        Maybe before we start with the main topic,
        
        could you tell us what is transitional justice?
        
        I'm sure there are a lot of people who don't
        
        know what this term means.
        
        ANNAH MOYO: Transitional justice basically
        
        refers to a set of measures that include truth, reparations,
        
        justice, and accountability and guarantees of non recurrence
        
        or conflict that are aimed at addressing
        
        the consequences of conflict, consequences
        
        of authoritarian rule, and other incidents that
        
        bring about gross human rights violations
        
        and other human rights violations
        
        and crimes in a particular setting, be it a society,
        
        a nation, a country, or a region.
        
        That is the simple definition of transitional justice.
        
        On the African continent, for instance,
        
        we have expanded this definition to really also include
        
        specific tenets of transformation
        
        or transformative justice, so to speak.
        
        So we are looking at these measures,
        
        including formal and non-formal measures or mechanisms
        
        also including traditional justice mechanisms
        
        to implemented the crown together with formal justice
        
        mechanisms to address consequences of violence,
        
        consequences of some of the tendencies
        
        and incidents in Africa, including legacies
        
        of Africa's brutal past to ensure that we move away
        
        from that history of brutalization and violations
        
        to economic transformation, developmental justice,
        
        and transformative justice.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: And have you used that framework
        
        in the context of CSVR to tackle the colonial crimes
        
        or the legacies of colonialism on the continent or somewhere
        
        else in the world?
        
        ANNAH MOYO: Indeed, Liliane.
        
        We are using that framework to address a number of occurrences
        
        on the continent.
        
        If you look at a number of countries
        
        on the African continent, some of the conflicts
        
        that we are experiencing currently really
        
        stem from some of the unresolved issues of the past.
        
        The colonial era legacies issues.
        
        Of land in Africa.
        
        That has not yet been redistributed, for instance,
        
        from the colonial era honors, for instance,
        
        is one of the root causes of conflict in Africa.
        
        Issues of access to resources, access to opportunities,
        
        for instance, access, for instance,
        
        to development in Africa still very much
        
        is an unresolved issue of the past.
        
        So we are using this framework of addressing
        
        the unresolved issues of the past and the colonial era
        
        legacies through transitional justice
        
        to ensure that we deal with issues
        
        of redistributive justice through transitional justice.
        
        We deal with the issues, for instance,
        
        of addressing some of the past issues, for instance,
        
        the high levels of inequality in a number of African countries
        
        really stem from Africa's unequal past
        
        when it comes to the rights, the access,
        
        and opportunities that are available for citizens
        
        vis a vis those available.
        
        For instance, for colonial masters or colonial era owners,
        
        for instance.
        
        Those who colonized Africa in the past.
        
        So we have an Africa, where our colonial era
        
        honors, or colonial era masters live
        
        alongside the majority of Africans who are poor,
        
        who are excluded from the mainstream economic activity
        
        because of the segregation and the exclusionary laws
        
        during colonial era.
        
        So how do we address some of those issues?
        
        We really need to rethink and relook at some of the issues,
        
        for instance, the inequalities brought about by colonialism
        
        in Africa, addressing them as some
        
        of the root causes of the current conflicts
        
        that we experience in Africa.
        
        Some of the tensions we see in a number of countries,
        
        for instance, are really need us to adopt
        
        that lens of addressing some of these issues
        
        through transitional justice and addressing them
        
        from a redistributive justice lens.
        
        That is one of the elements enshrined in the African Union
        
        Transitional Justice Policy as an element or a pillar
        
        of transitional justice to address
        
        some of these issues stemming from Africa's brutal past.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Can you give us
        
        concrete examples of how you are you
        
        are mobilizing this framework with specific countries?
        
        ANNAH MOYO: Certainly.
        
        Some countries, for instance, like Namibia are currently
        
        undertaking an audit around the land reform agenda,
        
        for instance.
        
        So we are coming in saying, there
        
        is a need to use transitional justice
        
        lens to that discussion.
        
        It cannot be simply a matter of land expropriation.
        
        It has to be an issue that is looked
        
        from a transitional justice lens,
        
        through risk redistributive justice that I spoke about.
        
        How does it look like from a transitional justice lens?
        
        How do we address this as an issue of the past?
        
        The unresolved past the colonial era legacy in Namibia,
        
        for instance.
        
        That, for instance, is causing tensions
        
        in the current governance in Namibia.
        
        So having a transitional justice lens
        
        then will ensure that we look at land ownership issues,
        
        and look at, for instance, who were
        
        the original owners of the land prior
        
        before colonial colonization and seeking then
        
        to at least redistribute land equally evenly
        
        amongst the populace of Namibia.
        
        So a transitional justice look then
        
        forces us, not only to look at it
        
        from an economic point of view or from a land ownership
        
        point of view, but to really look at who are the owners.
        
        In some instances, colonial lands
        
        belonging to ethnic groups was taken.
        
        So some of it really will require
        
        that we redistribute that land to the original owners
        
        and ensure that that ownership of the land
        
        to the original settlers is retained.
        
        But at the same time, addressing the high levels of inequality
        
        in the country through transitional justice.
        
        So with transitional justice we are
        
        looking at addressing or redressing some of the wrongs--
        
        the colonial era wrongs--
        
        at the same time, ensuring that we are transforming
        
        and developing the lives of Namibians
        
        currently in the current dispensation,
        
        ensuring that issues of equity equitable redistribution
        
        of resources of land and opportunities
        
        for agriculture, for economic development,
        
        and economic empowerment are distributed evenly
        
        across races, across ethnic groups,
        
        ethnicity, and across the population,
        
        the whole population, and the people of Namibia.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you very much,
        
        and I guess it's very obvious when you are on a continent.
        
        And when you can see every day like the different ways
        
        in which colonialism is still present
        
        and its legacy is still structuring
        
        the lives of the population.
        
        But what about-- do you think that we
        
        are this framework of transitional justice
        
        could be useful in tackling the legacies of colonialism
        
        in the global North, where maybe states like here and in Belgium
        
        could be inclined to say it's something
        
        which happened in the past which belongs to the past,
        
        it's not the present anymore.
        
        So first of all, do you think it's relevant,
        
        it could be useful, and how could it be done?
        
        ANNAH MOYO: Thank you, Liliane for that question.
        
        Issues of the past can never really
        
        be buried with the past, which is
        
        why, for instance, many former colonial countries will
        
        be pushing for to say it's in the past,
        
        let's let bygones be bygones.
        
        Let's move forward, but really, the past--
        
        at least in the African continent-- continues
        
        to haunt the present and it also threatens the future,
        
        for instance, because some of those legacies
        
        continue to be to manifest themselves
        
        as root causes of current conflicts
        
        and current manifestations of tensions that
        
        lead to conflict that can easily lead to gross human rights
        
        violations.
        
        So definitely, we need to revisit the past.
        
        If you look at a country like Germany, for instance, in 2018,
        
        Germany developed a transition adjusted strategy
        
        to deal with the past, especially
        
        in the African countries that were
        
        former colonies of Germany.
        
        Again, this was an acknowledgment by Germany
        
        of the fact that we cannot really bury the past.
        
        The past is very much present.
        
        The only way we can move forward and really begin
        
        the development--
        
        begin to give developmental aid to some of these countries
        
        is really by first and foremost addressing the past,
        
        because even though we may say we are moving forward
        
        collectively, but the very communities,
        
        the ethnic groups that were affected by genocide,
        
        gross human rights violations are slavery
        
        and many other international crimes
        
        that happened during the colonial era
        
        are very much wounded.
        
        They are still a wounded.
        
        The past is not in the past, but still very much alive.
        
        The experiences have been passed on through generations
        
        through narration oral history you name it.
        
        So communities are aware of what happened, and therefore, when
        
        nothing is being seen to be done to address or redress
        
        colonial era wrongs or legacies or crimes,
        
        then this fuels tensions amongst those communities,
        
        especially where the very same colonial era masters come
        
        in the name of providing aid, providing
        
        support and developmental and economic support
        
        to the very countries that they previously committed atrocities
        
        and wrongs to.
        
        So that is the fuels that tension, especially when
        
        now you look at other tensions, for instance,
        
        in other fault lines of ethnicity,
        
        fault lines of our political party, and association
        
        amongst others.
        
        So inasmuch as if a particular president in the global South
        
        may accept that aid, but those who are aggrieved
        
        or those who are affected, if they belong
        
        to the opposite ethnic group, for instance,
        
        this tends to fuel tensions amongst community members.
        
        And we have seen some of these tensions becoming
        
        a full blown conflict or full blown wars
        
        in some of the countries in Africa.
        
        Look at Angola, for instance.
        
        Look at countries, for instance, that are still now battling
        
        with a lot of with a lot of instability like Guinea
        
        that just had a coup recently.
        
        So these are some of the fault lines
        
        that usually when we don't address the past,
        
        then the past continues to haunt the present
        
        and it threatens the stability of the future
        
        and the sustainable peace that we try to build
        
        for future generations.
        
        So there is a need to address the past in order
        
        to secure the present and secure,
        
        again, a future that is free of violence and also
        
        that is transformational and leads to sustainable peace.
        
        So what I would say, for instance,
        
        for countries in the global North, especially
        
        European countries,
        
        Europe, for instance, developed a transitional justice policy,
        
        but what is a big gap in this policy
        
        is addressing issues of the past?
        
        So we are having a policy in the European Union
        
        that focuses on current and future conflicts
        
        without really addressing issues of the past.
        
        That, in itself, is a big gap, because we cannot dissociate
        
        the past and the current occurrences of conflict in many
        
        African countries from the colonial era.
        
        So there is a need for a holistic approach
        
        to addressing conflicts in Africa that really go back
        
        to the past.
        
        The colonial era wrongs, the colonial era legacies
        
        that has been unresolved until now.
        
        And starting from there, in order
        
        to build a culture of non-punity for those
        
        who committed those wrongs at the time,
        
        but also for future perpetrators of these crimes in the future,
        
        whether they are Africans or non Africans.
        
        And we are seeing a lot of proliferation,
        
        for instance, of guns coming from Europe, coming
        
        from the global North, for instance.
        
        So even the current conflicts, for instance,
        
        do have a starting point, they do
        
        have instigators and fuelers.
        
        So the wrong of the global North can never really
        
        be overlooked in the current conflicts.
        
        And addressing some of these really
        
        has to go back to the history, go back to the colonial era
        
        wrongs that were committed and start
        
        addressing them coming from the past, coming to the present,
        
        and then seeking also to secure and build
        
        a transformative, sustainable, peaceful future.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Before-- thank you very much.
        
        It's fascinating.
        
        Before we start this recording, we
        
        were talking about the technical nightmares
        
        or technical nightmare that we face
        
        when we bring those crimes, the colonial crimes into courts.
        
        So what are the constraints of using the transitional justice
        
        framework, because as you or you have said with many advantages
        
        related to the fact that we can tackle the roots of conflicts.
        
        So I think in terms of proscription,
        
        we have more advantages.
        
        Maybe you can develop on that point,
        
        but what are the constraints?
        
        To what extent is it really the way
        
        through which people have to frame or to shape
        
        their struggles?
        
        ANNAH MOYO: Thank you, Liliane, for that question.
        
        Indeed, I have alluded to some of the advantages
        
        and some of the opportunities for transitional justice
        
        to address this.
        
        One of the biggest opportunities I
        
        think just before I go into the constraints.
        
        One of the opportunities of transitional justice
        
        is that there is a recognition.
        
        For instance, when we are dealing
        
        with these issues through transitional justice
        
        that we are dealing with an abnormal situation, that
        
        therefore calls for some form of flexibility
        
        in terms of really looking at the narrower and very
        
        restrictive international law and international human rights
        
        tenets that seek to identify a perpetrator,
        
        seek to identify a victim, and therefore, the perpetrator
        
        must be brought to book and the victim must be redressed,
        
        but there must be reparation.
        
        But within a transitional justice, the higher number
        
        of trade-offs built within the system,
        
        for instance, yes, perpetrators have to be identified.
        
        And there has to be acknowledgment of having
        
        committed some wrongs.
        
        But at the same time, the kind of justice
        
        that we are talking about is not perfect justice,
        
        it is justice that comes with a number of trade-offs, where,
        
        for instance, sometimes an apology can be taken
        
        is what is needed to redress, for instance,
        
        or to satisfy those who are victims reparations,
        
        not in the true sense of the full measure of what
        
        the victim suffered, but as a token
        
        or as a symbol of acknowledgment.
        
        So symbolic reparations are some of the trade-offs,
        
        for instance.
        
        So it's not your perfect justice,
        
        but it's justice that comes with trade-offs,
        
        but that also acknowledges the experiences
        
        of those who suffered and also the perpetration of those
        
        who may have perpetrated the atrocities
        
        and those coming together coexisting
        
        towards moving forward, being transformed, transforming
        
        perpetrators, and victims into active citizens who
        
        can live alongside each other.
        
        Who can partner together in order
        
        to build a sustainable, peaceful future.
        
        So some of the constraints of transitional justice, once
        
        again, is the fact that there may not be political
        
        will, in most instances, from those
        
        who are seen to be perpetrators, especially
        
        for colonial era wrongs.
        
        The states who may have perpetrated those atrocities
        
        may not be willing to reopen the chapter
        
        to look at what happened, begin a process of truth seeking,
        
        then identification of perpetrators, acknowledging
        
        that indeed wrongs were committed
        
        and seeking to forge a path together with victims
        
        towards addressing some of these atrocities
        
        and together achieving, or rather building
        
        towards achieving sustainable peace in the long term.
        
        So there might not be any political will whatsoever.
        
        And transitional justice really relies on the political will
        
        and willingness of those who perpetrated
        
        those atrocities and the victim, or rather the countries
        
        to whom these wrongs were committed against.
        
        So that is the starting point.
        
        If this is not there, then any transitional justice talks
        
        will definitely fail, because both parties
        
        need to come to the table, need to initiate that conversation,
        
        and map out a transitional justice
        
        strategy on how this will be addressed.
        
        So that is number one constraint,
        
        and this is where, in most countries,
        
        even countries just where without in the global South,
        
        where there global North perpetrator,
        
        this is how many transitional justice processes
        
        fail because of that lack of political will.
        
        Another constraint that I can bring with transitional justice
        
        once again is just the issue around records.
        
        Because now, we are talking about what
        
        happened in the past.
        
        Colonial era in many African countries
        
        means more than 50 years of these atrocities
        
        having been committed.
        
        Some are committed in the 1900s.
        
        We are in 2021, so the direct victims have passed away.
        
        So there was no record keeping at the time.
        
        So issues of record keeping to really determine
        
        who was a victim, how they suffered
        
        and all of those things.
        
        So archives are not available in many countries.
        
        So really it's a word of mouth or experiences
        
        of victims passed on orally by word of mouth
        
        through generations.
        
        So the first-hand narrative of what happened may not exist.
        
        Some countries have really done well
        
        in terms of archiving what happened
        
        or keeping a national collective of what happened in the past,
        
        but in many instances for transitional justice,
        
        especially when we are looking at reparations,
        
        a direct or rather individual reparations,
        
        this may not be enough, for instance,
        
        to secure individual reparations for direct victims.
        
        It may not be enough for instance
        
        to secure a prosecution for those who may have committed
        
        those atrocities.
        
        But of course, other international law principles
        
        may kick in that will really help transitional justice
        
        processes.
        
        For instance, the International law principle
        
        in international human rights that even in instances where
        
        those who committed atrocities may not
        
        be in government at the time but the most current governments
        
        would belong to that specific state
        
        inherit the crimes committed by the previous government
        
        so they can still be held accountable.
        
        They can still be taken to court.
        
        They can still be called to answer or respond
        
        to some of the questions that may come up
        
        around transitional justice reparations and so forth
        
        and they can make an apology.
        
        They can pay reparations to victims.
        
        They can make symbolic reparations.
        
        They can come to the party in terms
        
        of acknowledging and admitting the wrongs that
        
        were committed in the past.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you very much.
        
        It's very clear.
        
        You mentioned at some point that were
        
        building a transitional justice strategy with the African
        
        Union.
        
        So do you think it's more--
        
        I mean on the issues of colonial crimes more relevant
        
        from the perspective of African countries
        
        to work at the regional level rather than
        
        at the national level?
        
        Yeah, and how this strategic, AU strategy, African Union,
        
        is going to be deployed, implement, and implemented?
        
        ANNAH MOYO: Thank you for that question.
        
        So the African Union developed the policy.
        
        It was adopted in 2019, and one of the issues that really it
        
        focuses on is addressing the colonial era
        
        legacies in Africa.
        
        And of course, the policy is continental,
        
        but it's still applying at a national level,
        
        for instance, for those countries that are affected.
        
        So the policy really is a guideline
        
        for member states undertaking transitional justice processes.
        
        So it provides a menu of transitional justice options
        
        that a country that is undertaking a TJ process
        
        can choose from in order to address
        
        the consequences of past violations,
        
        past and present violations.
        
        So the application is still very much at a national level,
        
        although the strategy really is applicable and exist
        
        at the continental level.
        
        So really, it's still very much obliged at continental level.
        
        But there are definitely alternatives
        
        of applying it regionally, especially where some
        
        of conflicts take a regional turn
        
        or take a regional manifestation, for instance.
        
        So those opportunities exist, and in addressing
        
        some of the regional concerns or regional manifestations
        
        of conflict are some of the regional economic communities
        
        are also now engaging taking that continental transitional
        
        justice policy and developing their own regional
        
        region-specific transitional justice policies
        
        or strategies to address some of the regional contextual
        
        realities.
        
        So it can apply regionally.
        
        It can also apply nationally, but we are seeing a trend now,
        
        where there is a regional strategy that really seeks
        
        to address some of the regional realities
        
        and experiences of conflict.
        
        As we see with some of these issues like violent extremism,
        
        there is the regional connotation to them.
        
        So a regional approach is much more
        
        preferred than a national approach that may not really
        
        address or redress the issues that
        
        affect a specific region or a number of countries
        
        within a region.
        
        LILIANE UMUBYEYI: Thank you very much,
        
        and I'm looking forward to having a discussion with you
        
        and the students and activists, because I think you are you
        
        bring a number of very important elements
        
        that we have to consider when we address or think
        
        about the possibility of pursuing justice
        
        for colonial crimes in the context of Belgium.
