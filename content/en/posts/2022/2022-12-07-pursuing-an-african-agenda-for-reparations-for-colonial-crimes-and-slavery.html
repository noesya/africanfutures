        <p>The issue of <b>reparations for<br>the historical injustices of colonization and slavery</b> is once again<br>figuring on international agendas. Over the past two years - and as a<br>result of pressure from civil society actors - European states such<br>as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany have undertaken processes to<br>recognize colonial violence in their former African colonies, while<br>international organizations such as the United Nations are<br>multiplying their calls for states to repair their colonial and<br>slavery-related violence. At the level of the African Union, a<br><b>Continental Agenda for Reparations</b> is starting to take shape. But<br>this growing attention to the question of reparations cannot be<br>achieved without the contributions of African civil society.</p><p>Civil<br>society across the African continent has already demonstrated its<br>will to have colonial crimes and their political, economic, social,<br>and material endurance on the continent recognized. For instance, in<br>a successful example in East Africa, former Mau Mau fighters brought<br>a legal case forward seeking reparations for torture they endured<br>during the struggle for independence. In North Africa, the Tunisian<br>Truth and Dignity Commission (Instance Vérité et Dignité)<br>established in 2014 demanded in its final report reparations from<br>France for the massive human rights violations committed by the<br>French army during the period from March 1956 to July 1961, which<br>resulted in over 7,000 Tunisian victims. The Commission's demands<br>have gone unheeded. More recently, in Southern Africa, after years of<br>negotiations, the Herero and Nama populations, as well as the<br>Namibian government, obtained compensation from Germany for the<br>genocide the colonial government perpetrated against these<br>populations in the early 20th century.</p><p>Despite<br>these advances, the scope and reach of efforts underway pale in<br>comparison to the scope of the crimes committed, and their deep and<br>enduring consequences on African societies, lives, and economies. To<br>contribute to an African agenda founded on robust, data-driven<br>knowledge, the African Futures Lab's project <b>"Advancing<br>the reparations agenda for colonial crimes and slavery in Africa,"</b><br>supported by the <a href="https://www.opensocietypolicycenter.org/" target="_blank">OpenSociety Policy Center</a><b></b>,<br>pursues the following objectives:<br></p><ol> <br><li>To<br><b>strengthen African civil society organizations' demands</b> for<br>reparations related to colonial violence and slavery and their<br>contemporary consequences on the continent with robust, data-driven<br>knowledge</li> <br><li> <br>To<br><b>coordinate African civil society actors</b> in designing a reparations<br>agenda for colonial violence and slavery and their consequences and<br>legacies<br> </li> <br><li>To<br><b>inform policymaking related to reparations</b> for colonial crimes and<br>slavery at the international, regional, and national levels (in<br>former colonial powers and former colonized states) with<br>recommendations formulated by African civil society actors</li> <br> </ol><ol><br></ol><p>Over<br>the course of the grant period (September 2022-September 2024),<br>AfaLab will conduct <b>research</b> on the state of reparations demands in<br>each of the 5 regions of the African continent and organize a series<br>of regional <b>Mobilization Labs</b> with civil society actors currently<br>involved in - or interested in - bringing forward claims for<br>reparations from states, corporations, and other institutions. The<br>MobLabs will not only yield strategies specific to the needs of<br>participants, but also <b>Regional Reparations Toolkits</b> that will serve<br>as a resource for civil society actors across the continent.</p><p>The<br>project's research team includes: AfaLab co-directors <a href="https://africanfutures.mit.edu/about-us/who-we-are/">Liliane<br>Umubyeyi, PhD</a><br>and <a href="https://africanfutures.mit.edu/about-us/who-we-are/">Amah<br>Edoh, PhD</a>,<br><a href="https://yaleisp.academia.edu/NoureddineAmara" target="_blank">Noureddine Amara, PhD</a>, <a href="https://www.aymarbisoka.com/" target="_blank">Aymar Nyenyezi Bisoka, PhD</a>, and <a href="https://legal.un.org/avl/faculty/Mubiala.html" target="_blank">Mutoy Mubiala, PhD</a>.</p><p>To<br>stay up to date on this and other AfaLab projects, subscribe to our<br><b><a href="http://eepurl.com/ifA1gX" target="_blank">Newsletter</a></b>!  </p>
