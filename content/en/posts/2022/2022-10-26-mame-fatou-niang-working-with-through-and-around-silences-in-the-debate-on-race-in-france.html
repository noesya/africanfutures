        <p>In this episode of Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur, we welcome <b>Dr. Mame Fatou Niang</b>, polyvalent US-based French scholar, filmmaker, writer, racial justice activist, and AfaLab Fellow. Mame discusses the state of the debate on race in France, what it means when your country, a country that prizes language, does not have - refuses - the words to name you and your experience. She talks about racial justice work against this invisibilization as mold-defying mosaic-making, about her enduring belief in universalism, about finding companionship in spaces of exclusion, and leveraging the silences to heal ourselves.</p><p>You can learn more about Mame Fatou Niang's writing, film and media contributions on her <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/modlang/about-us/filter/faculty/mame-fatou-niang.html" target="_blank">faculty webpage</a>.
