  This series series brings together activists, scholars, and lawyers working across eight countries in Europe, Africa, and North America. The collection of 11 essays addresses the following questions: What does justice look like in current struggles for global racial justice and demands for European countries to deal with their colonial pasts? What mechanisms are available for pursuing this justice? What is the place of African actors and institutions in these movements? What opportunities does this moment represent? What are the pitfalls? What will it take to sustain the current momentum?
