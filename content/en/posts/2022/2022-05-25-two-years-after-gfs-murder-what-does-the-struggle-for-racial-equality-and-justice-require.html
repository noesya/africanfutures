        <p>Two years ago already, on May 25, 2020, George Floyd was murdered by a white police officer in the city of Minneapolis during an arrest. Days later, protests against police violence and structural racism rose up in cities across the world. The protests - estimated at 8,700 across 74 countries - seemed to usher in a new moment in the global struggle for racial justice. This moment offered the promise of movements across the world joining forces to exert pressure on individuals, communities, private entities, and states for meaningful reform and repair. Two years later, results are decidedly mixed. </p><p>Where to, then, from here? How do we regain the momentum of 2020? How do movements for racial justice across Europe, the Americas, Africa and beyond build solidarity? How do we sustain ourselves?<br></p><p>Join us as we examine these questions and more in AfaLab's new podcast, "<b>Futur Antérieur | Future Perfect"</b>, premiering later this summer. The podcast will feature the work of activists, scholars, artists, policymakers, and others engaged in the struggle for racial justice across Europe, Africa, and the Americas. <b>Futur Antérieur / Future Perfect</b>, a verb tense that marks a future where an action necessary for that future to exist has been completed, captures our aim to shed light, through this podcast, on actions that can bring us to a future where racial equality and justice are a reality.<br></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>More details coming soon! </p>
