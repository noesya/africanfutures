        <p>The main objectives of the special parliamentary commission should not be to close the debate on Belgium's colonial past, but to pave the way for a global and long-term engagement with the Belgian colonial past."</p><p>The Belgian Parliamentary Commission investigating the nature and impact of Belgian colonialism in DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda is set to close in December 2022. With just a year given to the commission, closing investigations now will make the outcomes insufficient. </p><p>Public involvement, time, and resources must be expanded in order for the Commission to have an impact on how colonialism and its legacies are perceived in Belgium, the DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda</p><p>AfaLab has collaborated with ASF, Bamko ABSL, CaCoBuRwa, Bakushinta, and Christophe Marchand to release a jointly signed statement of their collective concern for the short time and minimal resources that have been given to the Commission to recognise the nature and extensive impact of Belgian colonialism. </p><p>Read the Press Release on ASF's website (<a href="https://asf.be/fr/blog/publications/press-release-special-parliamentary-commission-on-belgiums-colonial-past-a-closure-in-december-2022-will-not-allow-it-to-complete-its-mandate/" target="_blank">EN</a>, <a href="https://asf.be/fr/blog/publications/french-press-release-special-parliamentary-commission-on-belgiums-colonial-past-a-closure-in-december-2022-will-not-allow-it-to-complete-its-mandate/" target="_blank">FR</a>, <a href="https://asf.be/nl/blog/publications/dutch-press-release-special-parliamentary-commission-on-belgiums-colonial-past-a-closure-in-december-2022-will-not-allow-it-to-complete-its-mandate/" target="_blank">NL</a>) to understand the recommendations made by these Belgian civil society actors. </p>
