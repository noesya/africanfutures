        <p>In the last few years, we have witnessed an unrelenting race in the<br>development of<b> new technologies </b>that govern our socio-political,<br>economic, and cultural worlds. Racial justice actors and scholars have<br>extensively demonstrated the <b>racial bias</b> of the algorithms at the heart<br>of these technologies (and of the data scientists who develop them) and how<br>these new technologies are not only entrenching, but actually intensifying<br>racial violence in the "real world.".</p><p>Along with other civil society<br>actors waging battles in national, regional, and international spaces to<br>counter this trend, we, at Afalab, believe that <b>we cannot let algorithms<br>reproduce and extend racial violence.<br></b><br><br>In a context where the denial and invisibilization of historical and<br>contemporary racial injustices by state institutions as well as private actors<br>remain the norm, big data can help us highlight the systemic character of<br>racial injustices. Indeed, with European states refusing to collect<br>race-related data and reducing racism to isolated experiences of personal<br>prejudices, <b>we consider it imperative to explore the opportunities that big<br>data offer for making visible the extent and nature of racial injustices in<br>Europe.</b><br><br><br><br>We are acutely aware that big data wonâ€™t be the unique solution and that it has to be<br>complemented with other forms of data and rigorous analysis. Nonetheless, we<br>consider the urgency of racial inequalities in Europe, along with the<br>systematic refusal of states to collect data on race, as sufficient reasons to<br>explore the affordances of big data for addressing a critical void in the fight<br>for racial justice in Europe. <b></b></p><p><br><br></p><p>Therefore, <b>African Futures Lab is developing a<br>"Global Racial Inequality Dashboard</b>" that </p><p><br><br></p><ul> <br><li>Monitors racial injustices within<br> and across countries in Europe and Africa</li> <br><li>Documents demands for racial justice in those<br> regions</li> <br><li>Highlights institutional actions are taken to<br> address these issues</li> <br><li>Fills gaps in state-collected data (especially<br> in Europe) related to racial disparities and violence</li> <br><li>It will leverage data from a wide variety of<br> traditional and non-traditional sources, including existing datasets,<br> reports from civil society organizations, legal documents, and social<br> media to present a fuller picture of the effects of racism in an<br> accessible and actionable manner.</li> <br> </ul>
