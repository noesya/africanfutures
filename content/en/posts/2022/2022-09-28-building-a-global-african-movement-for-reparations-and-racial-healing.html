        <p>In this episode of <b>Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur</b>, we welcome Dr. Amara Enyia, President of Global Black, and Makmid Kamara, Executive Director of the Africa Transitional Justice Fund (ATJLF). ATJLF convened the recent <a href="https://accrasummit.com/">Accra Summit on Reparations and Racial Healing</a> (August 2022), a gathering that brought together activists, policymakers, and foundations to start establishing a common agenda for reparations that centers the African continent. The Accra Summit built on the <a href="https://global.black/">Reparations and Healing Convening</a>, a weeklong meeting of reparations and healing experts hosted by Nicole Hannah Jones and facilitated by Dr. Enyia in Bellagio, Italy in July 2022. The Convening’s aim was to address the legacies of the Transatlantic slave trade and develop collective strategies for achieving redress and repair. </p><p>In this conversation, <b>Makmid and Amara</b> share the motivations for and outcomes of these two gatherings as part of a broader movement underway for achieving reparatory justice and healing for Africans around the world. Along the way, they talk to us about why reparations is not solely about the past, but rather is a future-making, world-building project, and why imagination must be a cornerstone of efforts to address historical crimes and their legacies. </p><p>Read the<b> Accra Declaration on Reparations and Racial Healing</b>, a key outcome of the Accra Summit <a href="https://africanfutures.mit.edu/news/2022/08/31/accra-declaration-on-reparations-and-racial-healing/">here</a>.</p><p>**</p><p><b>Dr Amara Enyia</b> is a US-based Strategist, Public Policy Expert and Social Impact professional on city and state policy as well as international affairs with expertise in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia.

Prior to her current roles, she worked in the Mayor’s Office for the City of Chicago, served as Executive Director of community-based organizations, and, as a grassroots organizer, worked on issues of education equity, economic justice, and environmental justice.
