        <p>A wide range of issues faced by African Mothers and Métis born of Belgian colonization in their quest for justice and reparation were explored during the speakers’ presentations. Here are the key conclusions:<br></p><p>➡️<b> The Invisibility of African Mothers</b></p><p>Burundian, Congolese, and Rwandan mothers (too often invisible), are also victims of the policy of abduction and forced placement of their Métis children. The absence of these mothers from current government initiatives is a major blind spot in Belgium’s reparations policy.</p><p>➡️<b> Implementation of the 2018 Métis Resolution</b><br></p><p>The text of the 2018 Métis Resolution applies to all Métis born of Belgian colonization, irrespective of whether they live in the Great Lakes or in Belgium. This must be reflected in a systematic consideration of the Métis who were abandoned in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>AfaLab is deeply grateful to the speakers for their generosity in addressing such a complex and painful issue. We will continue to amplify the voices of the Great Lakes Métis and African mothers alike to achieve justice and reparations.</p>
