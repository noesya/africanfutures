        <p>Founded by two Black women in the aftermath of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests around the world, the African Futures Lab (AfaLab) works to advance demands for racial justice for Africans and Afro-descended people around the world.  We pursue the recognition and the repair of global racial injustices through the development and exchange of rigorous and empirically grounded knowledge across Africa and Europe. Concretely, our work consists of research, “Mobilization Labs” with partner organizations, and advocacy. </p><p>Together, these activities and outputs serve to bolster the efforts of activists and policymakers fighting to hold States and private actors accountable for the enduring effects of colonialism and slavery in Europe and in Africa. </p><p>Topically, our current projects touch on the intersections of racial justice and gender rights, climate justice, justice systems, and socio-economic inequalities. </p><p>The Lab is registered as a not-for-profit organization and our work is thoroughly transnational in nature. </p><p>You can learn more about the Lab, who we are, and what we do on our <a href="https://africanfutures.mit.edu/" target="_blank">website</a>. You can also find us on<a href="https://twitter.com/_AFALab_" target="_blank"> X (Twitter)</a> and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/african-futures-action-lab/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>. </p>
