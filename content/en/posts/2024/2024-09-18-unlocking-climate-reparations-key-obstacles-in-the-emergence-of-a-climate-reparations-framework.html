        <p>This paper aims to identify some of the principal obstacles affecting the development of an effective climate reparations framework within the international policy response to the climate crisis. </p><p>These obstacles need to be overcome to unlock the transformative potential of this emerging narrative to empower climate justice advocates in African countries to challenge the status quo in the international climate policy field.</p><p>The paper is intended as a conversation starter, to explore – through dialogue between affected communities, civil society organizations and government representatives from across the globe – how to further develop a climate reparations framework for African countries.</p>
