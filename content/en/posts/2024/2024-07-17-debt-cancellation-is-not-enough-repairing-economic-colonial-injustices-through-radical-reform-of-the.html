        <p>The report indicates that these are not demands to repair the past, but rather demands to end contemporary injustices that have concrete implications for the socio-political and economic future of the societies against which these injustices have been perpetrated.</p><p>Our research also shows that civil society organizations in Southern African countries are not unanimous on how to put an end to these colonial injustices, nor on the division of responsibilities between states and international financial institutions.</p><p>Most actors believe that debt cancellation can only be considered as a form of reparation for colonial injustice if the international financial architecture is overhauled.</p><p>A minority of actors, on the other hand, believe that debt cancellation and reform of financial institutions, while necessary, must not ignore the responsibility of states towards their own populations, both in terms of the choices they make regarding debt management and the racial inequalities within their populations.</p>
