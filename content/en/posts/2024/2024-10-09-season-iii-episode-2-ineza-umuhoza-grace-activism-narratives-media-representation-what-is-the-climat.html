        <p>In this podcast episode, Hélène Himmer and Brigette Perenyi, storytelling manager at Reform Initiative host a discussion with Ineza Umuhoza Grace, CEO of the Green Protector and Co. and founder of the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, about the need for climate reparations and the challenges faced by the Global South, particularly Africa, which bears the brunt of climate impacts despite contributing minimally to global emissions. This episode explores how youth activism is driving the climate justice and reparations movement, with a focus on amplifying the voices of vulnerable groups like women and indigenous communities in Africa.  Ineza emphasizes the need for these frontline communities to tell their own stories, rather than having international media impose narratives, ensuring their stories are heard and effective solutions are pursued. Furthermore, this episode advocates for unity among African nations to amplify their voices in global climate negotiations and address the tokenization of women, youth, and marginalized groups in international forums. Ultimately, the podcast calls for an inclusive, justice-driven approach to climate action that centers the voices and needs of those most affected by the crisis.</p>
