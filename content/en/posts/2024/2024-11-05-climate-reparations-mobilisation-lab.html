        <p>Drawing on the findings from the "Advancing the Climate Reparations Narrative in Africa" project, this MobLab is designed to enhance the capacity of African civil society organizations in advocating for climate reparations. Led by Program Assistant Hélène Himmer and organized by the African Futures Lab, the MobLab will bring together representatives from various African organizations, including Climate Hub Tanzania, KESHO Alliance, and the Ghana Youth Environmental Movement, to explore both local and international perspectives on climate justice and reparations. Through collaborative discussions and knowledge sharing, participants will deepen their understanding of international frameworks, engage with case studies from their countries, and work together to develop actionable solutions. This initiative aims to strengthen advocacy efforts, empower participants, and advance the climate reparations agenda within their national contexts.</p>
