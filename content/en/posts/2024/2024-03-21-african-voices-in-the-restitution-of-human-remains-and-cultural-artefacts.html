        <p>Conducted by <b>Amah Edoh</b>, this research documents African voices on the issue of restitution and sheds light on some of the challenges currently facing restitution processes in West Africa.</p><p>This study suggests that power imbalances continue to shape the dynamics between European and African actors in restitution processes and that developing the capacities of African actors and countries for engaging in restitution must be a priority if there is to be any chance of challenging the status quo.Â  <br></p>
