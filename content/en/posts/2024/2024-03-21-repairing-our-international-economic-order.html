        <p>There are many studies that point to socio-economic inequalities between racialised and white populations on a global scale. In the case of the African continent, this is typically blamed—in both popular and dominant political conversation—on the dysfunction of post-colonial African states and institutions.</p>

        <p>This perspective obscures the responsibility of former colonial powers. <b>Kennedy Manduna</b> and <b>Liliane Umubyeyi</b>'s research project, "<a href="https://www.afalab.org/news/2024-07-17-debt-cancellation-is-not-enough/" target="_blank">Debt Cancellation Is Not Enough! Repairing Economic Colonial Injustices through Radical Reform of the International Financial Architecture <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>", examines how demands for debt cancellation and for the reform of the international political and economic order as a form of reparations have been expressed within the context of Southern African States. This research analyses how civil society actors in South Africa perceive these demands, both in terms of their support and their reservations.</p>
