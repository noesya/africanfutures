        <p>Organized jointly with the <a href="https://www.geneva-academy.ch/" target="_blank">Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/" target="_blank">Amnesty International<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, and in partnership with the Association des Enfants des Belges Laissés au Congo (AEBLC), the Association des Métis des Grands Lacs (AMGL Burundi), the Association of Mixed Race Irish, the Collectif des Métis, and Justice Initiative; the conference drew on various cases of biracial child abduction in Africa and Europe to examine the experiences of African mothers and biracial people who have sought justice and reparations in recent decades.</p><p>Representatives from our Métis partner organizations had the opportunity to share with the audience poignant testimonies about the psychological impact of these abductions on the abducted children and their mothers. They also shared the obstacles they have encountered in their quest for justice and their determination to obtain recognition and reparations from Belgium for themselves and their descendants.</p>
