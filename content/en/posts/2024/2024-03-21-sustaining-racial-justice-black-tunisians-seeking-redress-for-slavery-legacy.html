        <p>This report aims to uncover the untold stories of different Black Tunisian communities. Narratives include stories of marginalization, discrimination and the impact and legacy of slavery in the daily interactions of Black Tunisians with their ‘white’ southern Tunisian counterparts.</p><p>It also addresses the general impact of the Tunisian revolution and its aftermath in their renewed conception of their identity as Black Tunisians, as well as their future expectations with regard to the Tunisian state's recognition of its historic marginalization. The report discusses the historic claims for justice and constraints faced by Black Tunisians, the contemporary claims for justice and reparations and how the Tunisian state is dealing with slavery and its legacy.</p>
