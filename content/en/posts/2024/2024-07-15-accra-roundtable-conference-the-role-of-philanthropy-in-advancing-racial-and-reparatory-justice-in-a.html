        <p>From 10 to 12 June 2024, the African Futures Lab, in collaboration with <a href="https://reforminitiatives.org/" target="_blank">Reform Initiatives</a> and <a href="https://wacsi.org/" target="_blank">WACSI</a>, organized a roundtable conference in Accra, Ghana, on the role of philanthropy in advancing racial and reparatory justice . The roundtable brought together thought leaders, funders, and policymakers from around the world to discuss how to strengthen the role of philanthropy in movements for reparations and racial justice.</p><p>The idea of this conference came from an observation in our recent report, <a href="https://www.afalab.org/news/2023-10-17-reparations-for-europes-colonial-crimes-in-africa-and-slavery-a-critical-step-in-tackling-africas-contemporary-challenges/" target="_blank">Multiple But Invisible: Reparations Demands For Colonial Crimes In The Great Lakes Region</a>, that the donor ecosystem of Africa as a continent has overlooked how current political, social, environmental and economic problems are intertwined with historical and contemporary systems of racial domination. This erasure of racial violence has not only allowed such violence to continue, but it has also perpetuated a culture of impunity relative to that violence.</p>

        <p>Within the United States, several philanthropic organizations have engaged in more profound reflection on their role in perpetuating racial inequalities and the need to address them. However, most of these efforts have been concentrated at the national level, particularly in the U.S.  Despite the efforts of a few U.S.-based foundations, there appears to be a reluctance to actively engage the issue of racial and reparatory justice in Africa and the African diaspora.</p><p>The conference organized in Accra was therefore an invitation extended to philanthropic organizations to recognize the limitations of their current approach in addressing the political, social, environmental, and economic problems affecting Africans and people of African descent in Africa and the African diaspora.<br></p>
