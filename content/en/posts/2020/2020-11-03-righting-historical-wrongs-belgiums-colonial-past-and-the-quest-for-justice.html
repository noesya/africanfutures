        <p>In July 2020, the Belgian parliament set up a Special Commission in charge of examining Belgium's colonial past in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. This Commission was set up right after the Black Lives Matter protests in Belgium. The establishment of this commission had a turbulent start, due to the lack of consultation with civil society. In this video, produced in collaboration with Avocats Sans Frontières and the Anti-Racism and Diversity Group of the European Parliament, several members of the civil society give their perspective on the relevance and the future of this commission. <br></p>
