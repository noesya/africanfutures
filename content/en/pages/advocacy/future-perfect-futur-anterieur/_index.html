        <p>Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur highlights individual and collective actions across Europe, Africa, and the Americas to defend racial equality and justice. Our guests - scholars, activists, artists - share their actions with us, highlighting both the forms that historical and contemporary racial violence takes in their context and examples of possible reforms and mobilizations. Through their experiences, we draw the contours of racial justice efforts today.  Future Perfect | Future Antérieur is hosted by Liliane Umubyeyi and Amah Edoh, co-founders of the African Futures Lab (AfaLab). A new episode is published every two weeks, and episodes alternate between French and English.<br></p>
