        <p>The Black Lives Matter protest movement has raised awareness globally on historical and contemporary racial violence and on the ways in which colonization and slavery still structure our societies. However, these protests have also led to a fierce backlash from states and from right-wing movements seeking to undermine this progress. </p><p><b>To counteract these dangerous trends in the public debate, AfaLab proposes the following interventions:</b></p><ul> <li>Production of <b>policy papers</b>, "Black Papers." Based on in-depth research and analysis, these policy papers articulate AfaLab's recommendations for policymakers.</li> <li>Production of <b>a podcast</b>, "Future Perfect/ Futur Antérieur" This podcast aims to deepen public understanding of racial inequality and violence in Europe and Africa and also to disseminate widely actions taken by individuals or groups to tackle this global problem. </li> <li>Organizing <b>conferences</b> that bring together researchers, activists and policymakers around the problem of racial inequality and violence, to discuss actions and reforms that can be taken to address this issue.</li> </ul><p>        <br>   </p><p> </p>
