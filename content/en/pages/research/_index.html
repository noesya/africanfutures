        <p>The historical and contemporary racial violence committed by European states during colonialism and slavery remains largely ignored by these states. As for historical violence goes, European states barely acknowledge their responsibilities for crimes committed during slavery and the colonial period. In the contemporary period, though the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests pushed states to move away from a politics of denial, progress in the recognition of their responsibility remains extremely limited.    </p><p>This lack of recognition leads to the persistence of racial violence and inequalities against African and Afro-desceded populations in Africa and Europe, but it also inhibits the necessary memory work with regard to historical crimes from happening.</p><p>    </p><p>In the face of these challenges, <b>AfaLab aims to produce knowledge </b>that will allow for close monitoring of past and contemporary racial injustices in Africa and Europe. </p><p>This objective is pursued through two types of interventions:</p><p>- Development and production of in-depth research reports on past and present racial violence.</p><p>- <span>Development of a racial justice dashboard focusing on </span>Europe and Africa. </p><p>      </p><p> </p>
