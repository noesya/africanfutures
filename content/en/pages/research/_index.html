        <p>The historical and contemporary racial violence committed by European states during colonialism and slavery remains largely ignored by these states. As for historical violence goes, European states barely acknowledge their responsibilities for crimes committed during slavery and the colonial period. In the contemporary period, though the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests pushed states to move away from a politics of denial, progress in the recognition of their responsibility remains extremely limited.    </p><p>                   Not only does this denial lead to the persistence of racial violence and inequalities against African and Afro-descended populations    in Africa and Europe, but it also inhibits the necessary work of memory and justice with regard to historical crimes from happening.</p><p>                   AfaLab aims at tackling this denial of responsibility by investigating historical and contemporary racial injustices and potential solution.    </p><p>This objective is pursued through two types of interventions:</p><ul> <li> Development and production of <b>in-depth research reports </b>on past and present racial violence. </li> <li> Development of a <b>racial justice dashboard</b>. </li> </ul>
