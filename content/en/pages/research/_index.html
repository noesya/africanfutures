        <p>African Futures Lab increases the understanding of the ways racial injustices intersect with socio-economic, environmental and gender inequalities across Africa and Europe through the production of research reports and policy papers.Â </p><p>Our research reports and policy papers are action-oriented: Ideas and knowledge inform public discussions and guide decision-makers in their pursuit of reform.</p><p>Recognising that knowledge production is inherently political, our research methodology centres on historically marginalised voices who have been disenfranchised based on race, nationality, gender, religion, ability, or other factors.</p><p>Our research methodology takes a cross-disciplinary approach: We value a wide range of expertise, and we invite as many different voices to the table as possible. We believe that expanding the proverbial table strengthens the work.</p>
