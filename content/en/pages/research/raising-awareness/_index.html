        <ul>  <li>  <b>We are action-oriented</b>: Ideas and knowledge developed in the Lab can inform public discussions and guide decision-makers in their efforts to undertake reform.</li>  </ul><ul>  <li>Recognizing that the production of knowledge is profoundly political, we <b>center historically marginalized voices</b>, based on race, nationality, gender, religion, ability, or other factors.</li>  </ul><ul>  <li>We take <b>a cross-disciplinary approach</b>: We value a wide range of expertise and we invite as many different voices to the table as possible. We believe that expanding the proverbial table strengthens the work.</li>  </ul>
