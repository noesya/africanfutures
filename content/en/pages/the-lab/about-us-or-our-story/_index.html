        <p><b>Liliane Umubyeyi</b> and <b>Amah Edoh</b> founded the African Futures Lab in the aftermath of the 2020 global Black Lives Matter protests because global racial injustices between Europe and Africa <b>were being overlooked</b> by agendas that were supposed to be tackling racial inequalities.</p>

        <p>Since the Black Lives Matter protests, we’ve seen many state and non-state action plans against racial inequalities focus on addressing inequalities within specific nations. This results in the neglect of Global racial injustices that still exist between Europe and Africa. Slavery and colonialism involved relations of domination between populations of different continents, their contemporary manifestations are global and still need to be addressed. </p><p>The invisibility of global racial injustices leads those seeking reform to feel powerless. Proving the responsibility of actors located in a country other than the one where the  injustices were committed requires transnational mobilization expertise and resources.</p>
