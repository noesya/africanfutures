        <p>The racial justice movements of 2020 highlighted the fact that racial injustice is a global and structural concern that is neither limited to national contexts, nor to individual prejudice. They underscored the importance of conceptualizing race and racism as a system of global dominance.</p><p><br>However, responses to the protests from former colonial powers largely ignored the structural and global aspects of racial injustice, reducing racial inequalities to a matter of individual prejudice confined to national borders.</p><p><br>We established the Lab to challenge this enduring denial of the global and structural manifestations of racial inequalities with evidence-based advocacy and policy recommendations.</p>
