        <p>From Black Lives Matter in the United States to protests in Africa and Europe calling for the legacies of colonialism and slavery to be addressed, societies across the world are faced with a pressing need to acknowledge their historical injustices and address the structural racism rooted in their social fabric.<br></p><p>Since the 2020 uprisings in response to the murder of George Floyd, partial and ad hoc responses have been undertaken by a number of states, including the restitution of artifacts, the payment of unilateral reparations, and the beginnings of transitional justice procedures between European and African nations. But these efforts remain insufficient. </p><p>African Futures Lab aims at tackling the lack of accountability regarding historical and contemporary racial injustices in Europe and Africa by:</p><ul> <li>                    <b>investigating</b> historical and contemporary racial injustices and potential solutions using field surveys, analysis of statistical information and archives, published in in-depth research reports.</li> <li> <b>supporting efforts</b> of racial justice actors to hold States and private actors accountable by generating empirically-grounded recommendations.</li> </ul><p>        </p><p> </p>
