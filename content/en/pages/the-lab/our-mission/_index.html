        <p><b>African Futures Lab strengthens the efforts of activists, researchers, and policymakers pursuing racial justice and the recognition of the enduring effects of colonialism and slavery.</b><br></p><p>From Black Lives Matter in the United States to protests in Africa and Europe calling for the legacies of colonialism and slavery to be addressed, societies across the world are faced with a pressing need to acknowledge their historical injustices and address the structural racism rooted in their social fabric.</p><p>Since the 2020 uprisings in response to the murder of George Floyd, partial and ad hoc responses have been undertaken by a number of states, including the restitution of artifacts, the payment of unilateral reparations, and the beginnings of transitional justice procedures between European and African nations. But these efforts remain both piecemeal and largely insufficient. <br></p><p>The African Futures Lab responds to the endemic scourge of racism and denial of colonialism and slavery's legacies across Europe and Africa. We achieve this by:</p><ul> <li>documenting historical and contemporary inequalities through both large-scale quantitative data-gathering and in-depth case studies;</li> <li>brokering knowledge exchange among social actors engaged in these efforts in a range of domains of practice and locations;</li> <li>and supporting advocacy by generating empirically-grounded policy recommendations for states, international organizations, and grassroots organizations.</li> </ul><p>        </p><p> </p>
