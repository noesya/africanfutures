        <p>Racial domination is evident in global relations between Europe and Africa, particularly in social, economic, migratory, and climatic issues. The history of colonization and its contemporary consequences have resulted in inequalities in development between the two continents that have a racial dimension, which is often overlooked.</p><p>This racial dimension is invisible and obscured by policies and programs of action aimed at reducing development inequalities between the two continents.</p>
