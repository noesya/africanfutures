        <p>Social movements, activists, policymakers need knowledge to develop their strategies and propose reforms. It is even more so in the case of racial inequalities and violence, when these realities are denied by states, as is the case in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>To enable civil society actors to strengthen their strategies, AfaLab proposes the following interventions:</p><ul> <li> Organization of <b>Mobilization Labs (MobLabs</b>):&nbsp; knowledge-building spaces where activists or can access different forms of expertise (legal, historical, economic, advocacy, communication) to build their strategies or their reforms. </li> <li> <b>Development of Toolkits:&nbsp;</b>AfaLab captures strategies (successful and not) deployed by civil society actors to address historical and contemporary racial violence. </li> </ul>
