In recent years - and under pressure from civil society actors - European states such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany have undertaken processes of recognition of colonial violence in their former African colonies, while international organizations such as the United Nations have multiplied calls for states to make reparations for colonial and slavery-related violence. At the African Union level, a continental agenda for reparations is beginning to take shape. But this growing attention to the issue of reparations cannot happen without the contributions of African civil society.</p><p>Civil society on the African continent has already demonstrated its willingness to have colonial crimes and their political, economic, social, and material consequences recognized. For example, in East Africa, former Mau Mau fighters have filed a lawsuit seeking reparations for the torture they suffered during the struggle for independence. In North Africa, the Tunisian Truth and Dignity Commission established in 2014 demanded in its final report reparations from France for the massive human rights violations committed by the French army between March 1956 and July 1961, which resulted in over 7,000 Tunisian victims. However, the Commission's demands went unheeded. More recently, in southern Africa, after years of negotiations, the Herero and Nama peoples, as well as the Namibian government, obtained compensation from Germany for the genocide that the colonial government perpetrated against them in the early 20th century.</p><p>Despite these advances, the scale and scope of ongoing efforts pale in comparison to the scope of the crimes committed and their profound and lasting impact on African societies, lives and economies.</p><p>In order to contribute to the development of an African agenda based on sound, data-driven knowledge, African Futures Lab launched the project "Advancing the Reparations Agenda for Colonial Crimes and Slavery in Africa," supported by the Open Society Policy Center, has the following objectives:</p><ul> <li> <b>Strengthen African civil society organizations' demands</b> for reparations related to colonial violence and slavery through sound, data-driven knowledge.</li> <li> <b>Coordinate the efforts of African civil society actors</b> in developing a reparations agenda for colonial violence and slavery</li> <li> <b>Inform the development of policies</b> related to reparations for colonial crimes and slavery at the international, regional, and national levels (in former colonial powers and former colonized states) with recommendations from African civil society actors.</li> </ul><p><b>3) Specific project objectives</b></p><p>As part of this broader initiative, we are carrying out research projects focusing on each of the five regions of Africa.
