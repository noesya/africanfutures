In recent years - and under<br>pressure from civil society actors - European states such as Belgium, the<br>Netherlands and Germany have undertaken processes of recognition of colonial<br>violence in their former African colonies, while international organizations<br>such as the United Nations have multiplied calls for states to make reparations<br>for colonial and slavery-related violence. At the African Union level, a<br>continental agenda for reparations is beginning to take shape. But this growing<br>attention to the issue of reparations cannot happen without the contributions<br>of African civil society.</p><p>Civil society on the African continent has already demonstrated its<br>willingness to have colonial crimes and their political, economic, social, and<br>material consequences recognized. For example, in East Africa, former Mau Mau<br>fighters have filed a lawsuit seeking reparations for the torture they suffered<br>during the struggle for independence. In North Africa, the Tunisian Truth and<br>Dignity Commission established in 2014 demanded in its final report reparations<br>from France for the massive human rights violations committed by the French<br>army between March 1956 and July 1961, which resulted in over 7,000 Tunisian<br>victims. However, the Commission's demands went unheeded. More recently, in<br>southern Africa, after years of negotiations, the Herero and Nama peoples, as<br>well as the Namibian government, obtained compensation from Germany for the<br>genocide that the colonial government perpetrated against them in the early<br>20th century.</p><p>Despite these advances, the scale and scope of ongoing efforts pale in<br>comparison to the scope of the crimes committed and their profound and lasting<br>impact on African societies, lives and economies.</p><p>In order to contribute to the development of an African agenda based on<br>sound, data-driven knowledge, African Futures Lab launched the project<br>"Advancing the Reparations Agenda for Colonial Crimes and Slavery in<br>Africa," supported by the Open Society Policy Center, has the following<br>objectives:</p><ul> <br><li> <br><b>Strengthen African civil society organizations'<br>demands</b> for reparations<br>related to colonial violence and slavery through sound, data-driven knowledge.</li> <br><li> <br><b>Coordinate the efforts of African civil society<br>actors</b> in developing a<br>reparations agenda for colonial violence and slavery</li> <br><li> <br><b>Inform the development of policies</b> related to reparations for colonial crimes and<br>slavery at the international, regional, and national levels (in former colonial<br>powers and former colonized states) with recommendations from African civil<br>society actors.</li> <br> </ul><p><b>3) Specific project objectives</b></p><p>As part of this broader initiative, we are carrying out research<br>projects focusing on each of the five regions of Africa.
