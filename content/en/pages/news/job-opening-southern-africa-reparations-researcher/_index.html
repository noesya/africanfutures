    <p>Short-term contract: Southern Africa Reparations Researcher  <br>   <br>Duration: 6 months, February-July 2023 (flexible); includes some on the ground <br>researchApplication deadline: Rolling, <br>until the position is filled.Required Qualifications: <br>PhD or <br>equivalent degree in qualitative and/or quantitative social sciences. <br>Relevant disciplines include but are not <br>limited to sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and legal <br>studies. <br>Topical <br>expertise in reparations, restorative justice, and/or racial justice movements <br>in Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South <br>Africa, eSwatini, Zambia, Zimbabwe).  <br>Demonstrated <br>experience in qualitative and/or quantitative social sciences research, <br>including field research. <br>Demonstrated <br>experience conducting operational research. <br>Excellent <br>writing, skills as demonstrated by publications record <br>Required <br>language skills: English, one or more national languages from the countries in <br>the region; Portuguese is a plus. <br>1) Project contextThe African Futures Lab's <br>(AfaLab) mission is to bring recognition and redress to past and <br>contemporary structural racial inequalities in Africa and Europe through the <br>development and exchange of rigorous, empirically-based knowledge. The knowledge <br>generated by this work informs the efforts of activists and policymakers. To this end, AfaLab documents racial inequalities and racial justice <br>movements through large-scale quantitative data collection and in-depth case <br>studies. Building on this empirical foundation, AfaLab promotes knowledge <br>exchange among social actors engaged in the fight against racial inequality and <br>supports advocacy efforts by producing empirically-based policy recommendations <br>for states, international organizations, and grassroots actors.2) Project description: <br>"Advancing the Reparations Agenda for Colonial Crimes and Slavery in <br>Africa"The issue of reparations for the historical injustices of colonization <br>and slavery is again on the international agenda. In recent years - and under <br>pressure from civil society actors - European states such as Belgium, the <br>Netherlands and Germany have undertaken processes of recognition of colonial <br>violence in their former African colonies, while international organizations <br>such as the United Nations have multiplied calls for states to make reparations <br>for colonial and slavery-related violence. At the African Union level, a <br>continental agenda for reparations is beginning to take shape. But this growing <br>attention to the issue of reparations cannot happen without the contributions <br>of African civil society.Civil society on the African continent has already demonstrated its <br>willingness to have colonial crimes and their political, economic, social, and <br>material consequences recognized. For example, in East Africa, former Mau Mau <br>fighters have filed a lawsuit seeking reparations for the torture they suffered <br>during the struggle for independence. In North Africa, the Tunisian Truth and <br>Dignity Commission established in 2014 demanded in its final report reparations <br>from France for the massive human rights violations committed by the French <br>army between March 1956 and July 1961, which resulted in over 7,000 Tunisian <br>victims. However, the Commission's demands went unheeded. More recently, in <br>southern Africa, after years of negotiations, the Herero and Nama peoples, as <br>well as the Namibian government, obtained compensation from Germany for the <br>genocide that the colonial government perpetrated against them in the early <br>20th century.Despite these advances, the scale and scope of ongoing efforts pale in <br>comparison to the scope of the crimes committed and their profound and lasting <br>impact on African societies, lives and economies.In order to contribute to the development of an African agenda based on <br>sound, data-driven knowledge, African Futures Lab launched the project <br>"Advancing the Reparations Agenda for Colonial Crimes and Slavery in <br>Africa," supported by the Open Society Policy Center, has the following <br>objectives:</p>  <p>Strengthen African civil society organizations' <br>demands for reparations <br>related to colonial violence and slavery through sound, data-driven knowledge.</p>  <p>Coordinate the efforts of African civil society <br>actors in developing a <br>reparations agenda for colonial violence and slavery</p>  <p>Inform the development of policies related to reparations for colonial crimes and <br>slavery at the international, regional, and national levels (in former colonial <br>powers and former colonized states) with recommendations from African civil <br>society actors. <br>3) Specific project objectivesAs part of this broader initiative, we are carrying out research <br>projects focusing on each of the five regions of Africa. Each region is studied <br>by one or two researchers. This call is specifically for a researcher for the Southern Africa region. Objectives: To take stock of ongoing mobilizations for reparations in each region <br>and/or to analyze specific cases of reparations demandsSpecific questions that may guide the analysis:</p>  <p>What are <br>the demands for reparations for crimes committed during colonization? <br>Who are <br>the actors making these demands? With what resources (political, legal, media, <br>material)? Which allies? <br>In which <br>arenas are demands being brought? To whom are they addressed? <br>What is <br>the history of these demands? <br>What do <br>these demands for reparations make possible for the mobilized actors? What do <br>they make difficult? <br>Operational aims of the research: To enable civil society actors to develop a <br>political/legal/communication strategy for their demands for reparations for <br>the historical crimes and contemporary legacies of colonialism and slavery.Collaboration with civil society actors and local universities is at the heart of <br>this researchDuration: 6 months (~February 2023 - July 2023). These dates are flexible.Two elements are central to this research: It is operational in focus and it must start from existing civil society actors' mobilizations on the ground. <br>The methodology can be qualitative or quantitative.</p>  <p>Please send CV and cover letter, and any questions, to info@afalab.org.</p>  <p> Short-term contract: Southern Africa Reparations Researcher  <br>   <br>Duration: 6 months, February-July 2023 (flexible); includes some on the ground <br>researchApplication deadline: Rolling, <br>until the position is filled.Required Qualifications: <br>PhD or <br>equivalent degree in qualitative and/or quantitative social sciences. <br>Relevant disciplines include but are not <br>limited to sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and legal <br>studies. <br>Topical <br>expertise in reparations, restorative justice, and/or racial justice movements <br>in Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South <br>Africa, eSwatini, Zambia, Zimbabwe).  <br>Demonstrated <br>experience in qualitative and/or quantitative social sciences research, <br>including field research. <br>Demonstrated <br>experience conducting operational research. <br>Excellent <br>writing, skills as demonstrated by publications record <br>Required <br>language skills: English, one or more national languages from the countries in <br>the region; Portuguese is a plus. <br>1) Project contextThe African Futures Lab's <br>(AfaLab) mission is to bring recognition and redress to past and <br>contemporary structural racial inequalities in Africa and Europe through the <br>development and exchange of rigorous, empirically-based knowledge.
