        <p>A lot of expertise is needed to prove the responsibility of the authors of these global racial injustices. AfaLab supports civil society organizations, as well as private and public entities, in building strategies to tackle these global racial injustices.</p><p>This support is built through collaborative working spaces (Mobilization Labs or MobLabs) where strategies can be developed and/or strengthened.</p><p>As multiple forms of expertise are necessary for revealing the many facets of global racial injustices, MobLabs bring together a range of specialists: historians, economists, anthropologists, lawyers, community organizers, communication experts, and others relevant experts. </p>
