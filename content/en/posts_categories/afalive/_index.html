        <p>On one hand, The Guardian’s acknowledgement this past March of its founders’ links to the transatlantic slave trade as part of its Cotton Capital special series and the NYTimes’ publication last year of “The Ransom,” a special series on the reparations that Haiti was forced to pay to France for its independence. On the other hand, a 500% increase in the use of a racial slur on Twitter following the platform’s take-over earlier this year. </p><p>Traditional news media and online media alike have a clear influence on not only drawing and raising attention to the debates and discourses around racial justice, whether in the Global North or South, but also on shaping them. They can also  serve as a platform for protest and for the denunciation of racial injustices and they can also vehicle racist discourses, stereotypical narratives, and even enable rising extreme right-wing groups to spread their racial hatred and ideology. Indeed, media today - as ever - are doing more than merely relaying information; they are actors in the fight for reparations and racial justice more broadly. </p><p>This leads us to the question: How can the media be called upon strategically to advance the efforts of racial justice today?  </p><p>For its second live Twitter discussion on June 29th at 8:30 pm, the African Futures Lab invites you to a conversation about the role of media in orienting the discourse about race and racial justice in and across Europe and Africa today. </p><p>Our discussion will feature two distinguished guests: </p><ul><li> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natashakimani/" target="_blank"><b>Natasha Kimani</b></a>, Head of Partnerships and Research at <a href="http://africanofilter.org/home" target="_blank"><b>Africa No Filter</b></a>.
