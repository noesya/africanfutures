Amah was Assistant Professor of Anthropology and African Studies at MIT from 2017 to 2022, where she was recognized with multiple awards for excellence in teaching. She has taught courses on the politics of knowledge production, contemporary francophone Africa, African migrations, and contemporary movements for racial justice and reparations. Amah's research has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the Ford Foundation. She holds a PhD in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society from MIT, a MSc in Population and International Health from Harvard, and was a Fulbright Scholar to Zambia.
