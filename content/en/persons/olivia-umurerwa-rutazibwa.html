She is currently Assistant Professor in Human Rights and Politics in the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics (LSE). Dr. Rutazibwa holds a PhD in Political Science/International Relations from Ghent University in Belgium (2013), prior to which she undertook doctoral training at the European University Institute in Italy (2001-6) as well as internships at the European Commission in Brussels and the EU Institute for Security Studies in Paris (2003-4).

Dr. Rutazibwaâ€™s research and teaching focuses on ways to decolonise (international) solidarity. Building on epistemic Blackness as methodology, she turns to recovering and reconnecting philosophies and practices of dignity and repair and retreat in the postcolony (e.g. autonomous recovery in Somaliland, agaciro in Rwanda and Black Power in the US, Tricontinentalism and the political thought of Thomas Sankara) to theorise solidarity anticolonially. Prior to her scholarly career, Dr. Rutazibwa was a journalist.<br></p> </div>
