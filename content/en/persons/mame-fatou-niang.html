<p>Mame-Fatou Niang is Associate Professor of French and Francophone Studies at Carnegie Mellon University and the author of Identités Françaises (Brill, 2019). Mame’s research focuses on race, immigration and national identity in contemporary France.  In 2015, I co-directed the documentary film, Mariannes Noire. She is also a photographer and the co-author of a photo series on Black French Islam. Prof. Niang is currently working on a second manuscript tentatively titled Mosaica Nigra: Blackness in 21st-century France.</p>
