Eva Njoki Munyiri is a Kenyan documentary filmmaker and producer. Well known for the film Waithira ,she is also the founder of Curious Kid, a Kenyan based production house. Eva is currently working on a documentary “A Bomb for Pan Africa” on the story of Carlos Moore, who speaks of race as the most fundamental issue of our time. The clarity of his vision from a young age – a quest to unite the black world – led to a series of encounters that would culminate in a secret project to build Africa´s first nuclear weapon.
