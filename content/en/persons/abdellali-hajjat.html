<div>   <p>Abdellali Hajjat is Associate Professor of Sociology at the Université Libre de Bruxelles since 2019. He was Associate Professor of Political Science at the University Paris Nanterre (2010-2019) and EURIAS Junior Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (University of Edinburgh). He recently published <i>French Islamophobia. How the elites forged the “Muslim problem”</i> (University of Georgia Press, 2022, with Marwan Mohammed); <i>The Wretched of France: The 1983 March for Equality and Against Racism</i> (Indiana University Press, 2022) and <i>Les frontières de l’“identité nationale”: l’injonction à l’assimilation en France métropolitaine et coloniale</i> (La Découverte, 2012). His research focuses on various issues: citizenship and race in French law; urban uprisings and political mobilizations by postcolonial immigrants in France in working-class neighborhoods, particularly in May 68 and afterwards; Islamophobia as a “total social fact,” the construction of the “Muslim problem” and the redefinition of French secularism; hate crime and the criminal justice system; and postcolonial controversies in Belgium.</p> </div>
