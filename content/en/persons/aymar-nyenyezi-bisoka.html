<p>Aymar Nyenyezi Bisoka is a lawyer, political scientist and Assistant Professor at the University of Mons. He received his doctorate degree from the School of Political and Social Sciences of the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. His doctoral dissertation focused on land grabbing by local elites in the African Great Lakes region: Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Rwanda), particularly on issues of power and resistance in relation with access to natural resources in this region. In addition to natural resources, his research also focuses on the conceptualization of the Afro-critical perspective in the social sciences.</p>
