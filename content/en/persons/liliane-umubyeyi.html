<p><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </p><p>Liliane Umubyeyi is a Rwandan and Belgian Rule of Law and Access to Justice researcher and practitioner. Prior to establishing AfaLab, Liliane worked in the field of<br>international development (United Nations, United Nations Development Program, International<br>Centre for Transitional Justice, Lawyers without<br>Borders, and the American Bar Association) on projects concerning<br>access to justice for marginalized groups, transitional justice, and gender justice. This professional background and her lived experience in Africa (Rwanda,<br>South Africa, Central African Republic) and in Europe (Belgium, France) inform her<br>thinking about the decolonization of development policy and practice, the<br>decolonization of international law and justice<br>systems, and the possibilities for repairing historical and contemporary racial<br>violence. Liliane holds a PhD in Social Sciences from the Ecole<br>Normale Supérieure de Cachan (France) and in Law from the Université Saint<br>Louis Bruxelles (Belgium), and her dissertation focused on apartheid victims'<br>mobilizations in South African and American courts.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
