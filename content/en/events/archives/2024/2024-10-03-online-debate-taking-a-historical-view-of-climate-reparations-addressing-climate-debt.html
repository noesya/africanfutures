        <p>In this online debate, we will explore one of the most pressing challenges of our time—climate reparations and the concept of climate debt. As the global community increasingly recognizes the historical responsibility of European and  industrialized nations for exacerbating the climate crisis through centuries of industrialization and pollution, the demand to settle climate debt has intensified.</p>

        <p>Though the idea of climate debt is well-defined at international forums, applying this concept in practice remains elusive. To address this, we need to take a step back and examine the historical context—starting from colonialism to modern industrialization—tracing the roots of climate reparations. By understanding the past, we can pave a more effective path toward meaningful climate justice. In this debate, we’ll discuss how to transition from acknowledgement of climate debt to tangible reparations. What legal and policy frameworks can be utilized, and how can history shape the path forward?</p>
