        <p>In our recent report, <a href="https://www.afalab.org/news/2023-11-29-multiple-but-invisible-reparations-demands-for-colonial-crimes-in-the-great-lakes-region/" target="_blank"><i>Multiple But Invisible: Reparations Demands For Colonial Crimes In The Great Lakes Region</i></a>, we highlighted how the donor ecosystem in Africa often overlooks the political and socio economic issues related to the crimes of slavery and colonization.</p><p>Many international development organizations, often tied to former colonial powers, show little interest in addressing the responsibility of Northern countries for colonial crimes and their ongoing impact. However, it's crucial to recognize that many political, economic and social challenges in Africa are directly linked to the legacy of colonization.<br></p>

        <p>With this in mind, we have been thinking about how philanthropic institutions can support racial and reparations justice initiatives in Africa and the African diaspora.</p><p>To explore this question, we are partnering with <a href="https://reforminitiatives.org/">Reform Initiatives</a> and <a href="https://wacsi.org/" target="_blank">The West Africa Civil Society Institute</a> (WACSI) to host a roundtable conference. This event will bring together thought leaders, grantmakers, and policymakers from around the world to discuss how to strengthen the role of philanthropy in the reparations and racial justice movements.</p><p>By bringing together representatives from diverse philanthropic institutions, this roundtable aims to create a safe space for philanthropists to share their understanding of reparations campaigns. It will also explore how civil society and policymakers can leverage the opportunities offered by the philanthropic community. <br></p>
