        <p>In this episode of Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur, we speak with Prof. Menna Agha, architect and Assistant Professor of Architecture at Carleton University, in Ottawa, Canada. Menna's research focuses on gender and space, with a particular emphasis on displaced Nubian populations. In this conversation, we learn not only about how, for a population for whom the Nile river has been a life source for millenia, forced displacement is a form of epistemicide, but also about the legacy of refusal that continues to inform Nubian populations' claims to their homelands - as well as Menna's approach to design and scholarship. We also talk about the power of allyship with other Black and Indigenous populations across the world. Importantly, we muse on what it means to be guided by the voices of our foremothers and to call upon our ancestors as sources as we challenge Eurocentric knowledge systems and values.</p><p>*</p><p><span>Menna Agha is an architect and Assistant Professor at the University of Carleton. She has recently been coordinating the spatial justice agenda at the Flanders Architecture Institute in Belgium. She is a third-generation displaced Fadicha Nubian, a legacy that infuses her research interests in race, gender, space, and territory. Among her publications are: </span><span>Nubia still exists: The Utility of the Nostalgic Space</span><span>; </span><span>The Non-work of the Unimportant: The shadow economy of Nubian women in displacement villages</span><span>; and </span><span>Liminal Publics, Marginal Resistance</span><span>.  </span></p>
