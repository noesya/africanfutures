  To mark this year’s International Day for People of African Descent, a global coalition of diplomats, scholars, activists, artists, and civil society organizations ( in which AfaLab is a member)  today released The Accra Declaration on Reparations and Racial Healing”, a groundbreaking document to chart a new path for the reparations movement.
  
  The Declaration is the outcome of an international convening focused on reparations and healing held earlier this month in Accra, Ghana, and keynoted by President of Ghana, His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. Scholars, activists, journalists, and human rights activists like Dr. Julius Garvey, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Dr. Hilary Beckles, and economist Darrick Hamilton were amongst attendees.
  
  Building on The Abuja Proclamation of 1993 and the Durban Declaration and Program of Action of 2001, The Accra Declaration highlights the legacies of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, colonialism, and ongoing harms. It calls for the United Nations Permanent Forum on People of African Descent to convene a global summit of former colonial powers on the issue of reparations, calls for the development of prosperous economies through reformation of global systems and structures, and the return of stolen artifacts.
  
  It also calls for the United Nations to extend the United Nations Decade for People of African Descent, and for a process of acknowledgement and healing for the roles that both Europe and Africans played in the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade.
