<p>AfaLab and Data-Pop Alliance will co-develop a “Global Racial Inequality Dashboard” that will provide a transcontinental view of racial inequality and injustice through the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. The resulting indicators and insights will aim to advance civil society associations and policymakers’ policy, advocacy, and awareness-raising efforts to address structural racism and inequalities in selected countries, including those where such data are not collected. The Dashboard will:</p><ul> <li> </li> </ul><p>Monitor racial violence and inequalities within and across countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa</p><p> </p><p></p><li> <p>Document demands for racial justice in those regions</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Highlight institutional actions are taken to address these issues</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Fill gaps in state-collected data (especially in Europe) related to racial disparities and<br>violence</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> </li> <p>It will leverage data from a wide variety of traditional and non-traditional sources, including existing datasets, reports from civil society organizations, legal documents, and social media to present a fuller picture of the effects of racism in an accessible and actionable manner.</p><p>In DPA’s “<a href="https://bit.ly/3wZc7Tl." target="_blank">Overview and Outlook Report 2021-2023,” </a>this vital project is highlighted. </p><p><b></b><br></p>
