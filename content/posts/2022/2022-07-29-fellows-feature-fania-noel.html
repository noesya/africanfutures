        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology, and I am an AfroFeminist organizer. I joined academia to think deeply about some questions, and this was a way to buy time for five years. When you have work and do activism, time is rare and something you need - so that is what led me to my Ph.D. Since I was already on that path of academia, I am still on the same topic, but from an analytical point of view, even though being an activist is already deeply analytical. This is more time to reflect on what we're doing as a Black organization, for instance.</p>

            My own practice is to create popular education where people meet, talk and radicalize their political consciousness. My own brand of work is to make organizations mobilize people, and put them on the street. Put them also in the position to think about their material conditions.
