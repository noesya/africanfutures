      What led you to focus on racial justice and/or historical redress in your work?

        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology, and I am an AfroFeminist organizer. I joined academia to think deeply about some questions, and this was a way to buy time for five years. When you have work and do activism, time is rare and something you need - so that is what led me to my Ph.D. Since I was already on that path of academia, I am still on the same topic, but from an analytical point of view, even though being an activist is already deeply analytical. This is more time to reflect on what we're doing as a Black organization, for instance.</p>

            My own practice is to create popular education where people meet, talk and radicalize their political consciousness. My own brand of work is to make organizations mobilize people, and put them on the street. Put them also in the position to think about their material conditions.

      How do you engage with audiences / publics outside of your own area of practice? What has worked well in this process, what have been some challenges?

        <p>For me, it's really easy because I am in academia and an activist in many groups. I founded and created journal reviews, and projects. My own practice is to create popular education where people meet, talk and radicalize their political consciousness. My own brand of work is to make organizations mobilize people, and put them on the street. Put them also in the position to think about their material conditions. So I think I am engaging in that in my own journey in academia by doing and being involved in the Gender and Sexuality students at the New School, by organizing panels for the public that are close to my area of work, but not my area of work. Writing also for mainstream and general publications. Talking with students and fellow Ph.D. students about what we can build together as a graduate conference, and participating in other conferences.</p><p>Engagement with the audience and public outside of my own area of practice is every day because I am really present in the socio major and a lot of public events and interning (?).</p>
