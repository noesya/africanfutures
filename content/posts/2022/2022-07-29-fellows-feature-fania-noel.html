      What led you to focus on racial justice and/or historical redress in your work?

        <p>I think that what led me to do this work, my own path, before joining academia, now I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology, and I am an Afroframesca organizer. I joined academia to think deeply about some questions, and this was a way to buy time for five years. When you have time and do activism, time is rare and something you need - so that is what led me to that, since I was already on that and I am still on the same topic, but in an analytical point of view, even though being an activist is already deeply analytical. This is more time to reflect on what we're doing as a Black organization for instance.</p>
