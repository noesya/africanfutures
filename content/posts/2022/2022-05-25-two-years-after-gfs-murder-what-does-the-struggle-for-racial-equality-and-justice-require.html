Days later, protests against police violence and structural racism rose up in cities across the world. The protests - estimated at 8,700 across 74 countries - seemed to usher in a new moment in the global struggle for racial justice.

The podcast will feature the work of activists, scholars, artists, policymakers, and others engaged in the struggle for racial justice across Europe, Africa, and the Americas. <b>Futur Antérieur / Future Perfect</b>, a verb tense that marks a future where an action necessary for that future to exist has been completed, captures our aim to shed light, through this podcast, on actions that can bring us to a future where racial equality and justice are a reality.</span><br></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>More details coming soon! </p><p><b></b><br></p>
