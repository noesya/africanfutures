        <p>What's to be repaired? - Postcolonial Justice in Postcolonial Europe</p><p>Organised by JamilaMascat (UU), and Krista King (UU), in partnership with <a href="https://www.bakonline.org/">BAK - basis voor actuele kunst</a> and <a href="https://casco.art/">Casco Art Institute</a></p><p>When: from 22nd to 24th of June 2022 </p><p>Where: Utrecht University, BAK, and Casco Art Institute</p><p>In 2001, the UN World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, also known as the Durban Conference was one of the first instances where the countries of the Global North were asked to address and repair the legacy of "the massive human sufferings and the tragic plight of millions of men, women and children as a result of slavery, slave trade, transatlantic slave trade, apartheid, colonialism and genocide". On that occasion the <a href="https://www.un.org/WCAR/durban.pdf">Durban Declaration</a> categorised slavery, colonialism, apartheid, and genocide as international crimes against humanity establishing a clear connection between such historical atrocities and contemporary forms of anti-black discrimination, racism, and racial inequalities. Since Durban, however, calls for colonialism and slavery reparations by decolonial activists, anti-racist advocacies and human rights groups have been met with skepticism by European governments. More recently, after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the long wave of Black Lives Matter protests across the globe, international debates on reparations seem to have gathered momentum.</p><p>Twenty years after Durban, this three-day symposium brings together interdisciplinary academics, experts, and activists to discuss postcolonial reparations as a strategy for fighting postcolonial inequalities, combating structural racism, and decolonising societies in Western Europe.</p><p>Participants: Valerie Arnould (ASF-Lawyers without borders, Brussels), Alessandra Benedicty Kokken (Research Center for Material Culture at Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, Amsterdam), Magali Bessone (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne), Casco Art Institute (Utrecht), Arnaud Dandoy (ASF-Lawyers without borders, Brussels), Amah Edoh (MIT/African Futures Action Lab), Ajmal Hussain (University of Warwick), Nicole Immler (Universiteit voor Humanistiek, Utrecht), Maria Hlavajova(BAK), Wietske Maas (BAK), Brianne Mc Gonigle(UU), Mame-Fatou Niang (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh), Rafał Pankowski (NW-Never Again/Collegium Civitas, Warsaw), Liliane Umubyeyi (African Futures Action Lab), Carine Zaayman (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam/Research Center for Material Culture at Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, Amsterdam), Cindy Zalm (Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, Amsterdam).</p><p>The symposium will also host:</p><p>The screening of the film <a href="http://kaderattia.de/les-entrelacs-de-lobjet-the-objects-interlacing-2020/">The Object's Interlacing</a> (2020) by Kader Attia at BAK, with an introduction by Maria Hlavajova (BAK) and Wietske Maas (BAK) - June 22nd.</p><p>The European launch of the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/africanfutures/#/">African Futures Action Lab</a> - a newly founded for knowledge and policy development committed to strengthening racial justice movements across Africa, Europe and the Americas - with co-founders Amah Edoh and Liliane Umubyeyi - June 23rd.</p><p>A guest lecture by Mame-Fatou Niang "French, but not (Q) White?: Expanding Frenchness for the 21st Century", as part of the Lecture series <a href="https://nosophi.hypotheses.org/vie-scientifique/seminaire-race-et-culture-questionnements-philosophiques">Race et culture</a> organised in partnershipbyUtrecht University, Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne,  and École Normale Supérieure de Lyon - June 24th.</p><p>For the daily programme, locations, and further updates, please check the event <a href="https://whatstoberepaired.wordpress.com/">website</a>. </p><p>For registration, please send an email to this address: whatstoberepaired2022@gmail.com</p>
